 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening just below the zero line, the trace vaults almost immediately into a fast, nearly straight climb that reaches its dominant summit close to index 14.  It then slides back toward the axis, actually slipping a little into the red around the low thirties, rebounds to a noticeably lower hill near index 42, dips again, lifts once more to an even smaller hump at about index 67, and thereafter ebbs steadily downward into an extended, slowly declining negative stretch marked only by low-amplitude ripples.  
→ best match: class_2  

signal 2  
A brief positive tick at the very start gives way to a long, shallow negative basin that lasts until the mid-sixties.  From there the curve rockets upward in a protracted ascent that crests at its principal peak roughly at index 71, after which it rolls back down through zero into a broad, almost flat negative plateau.  Aside from a later, noticeably smaller rebound that tops out near index 160, the remainder of the record drifts quietly lower with only light noise.  
→ best match: class_1  

signal 3  
The series opens with a faint negative wobble punctuated by a tiny positive flicker, drifts a little further down, and then launches into a single steep ramp that attains its highest summit around index 63.  It then slopes away, crossing the axis in the early seventies, and – after settling briefly below zero – lifts into a broader but far lower second crest centred on about index 150.  From there it subsides smoothly into a long, gently undulating negative shelf.  
→ best match: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens with a momentary dip below zero, then shoots up in a rapid, almost straight climb to its dominant summit near index 14.  From that crest it eases down through a series of ever-smaller positive steps, crosses the baseline in the low thirties, rebounds into a mid-sized ridge around index 41, dips again and throws up a last, still smaller bump that tops out close to index 66.  After slipping back through zero in the early seventies the trace drifts away in a long, very flat negative shelf disturbed only by low-amplitude noise.  

Best-matching class: class_11  
(Alternative that also resembles it, but less closely because it allows for only one secondary hill, would be class_2.)

Signal 2  
A tiny positive blip is followed by a gentle slide that settles into a shallow, fairly level negative plain lasting to about index 60.  A sudden steep ramp then lifts the curve to a first sizeable peak at roughly index 69; it falls away sharply through zero into a broad, deep negative terrace, lingers there for some time, and then gathers strength for a second and highest crest that rises near index 158.  From that apex it slopes downward once more and finally comes to rest on a wide, only lightly rippling negative plateau.  

Best-matching class: class_4  
(The two-peak layout with the later summit higher than the earlier one fits class 4 most convincingly.)

Signal 3  
The series begins with low-level mixed flutter around the zero line, sinks slightly negative, then launches into a single steep ascent that reaches its overall maximum close to index 63.  It glides down from that peak, slipping through zero just after index 70 and continuing into a long negative stretch.  Part-way through this section it arches back into a noticeably smaller secondary hill centred near index 162 before descending once more into a broad, almost flat negative shelf peppered with only minor undulations.  

Best-matching class: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1 – description  
It opens with a tiny sub-zero blip, then climbs through a rather jagged but steadily rising positive run that crests in a sharp, overall-tallest summit at about index 14.  From there it slides back toward the axis, dips only briefly, then edges up again to a modest ridge near index 42, and once more to an even smaller hump centred roughly at index 67.  After crossing the zero line in the low seventies it never regains height: the trace drifts down and spreads out into a long, almost level negative table whose only interruptions are a few faint flickers (one near index 99) before settling into a flat, low-amplitude trough that persists to the end.  
Best-matching class: class_11  

Signal 2 – description  
A short early positive flick is quickly replaced by a lengthy, shallow negative basin.  Out of this basin the curve powers upward in a sustained charge to an intermediate peak around index 70, slips back through zero and rests for a while on a wide, moderately deep negative shelf.  From that shelf it launches a second, stronger ascent that reaches the overall apex close to index 158.  Thereafter the profile rolls downhill once more, flattening into an extended, gently undulating negative terrace that carries on to the finish.  
Best-matching class: class_4  (the only template featuring two main crests with the second the higher)  

Signal 3 – description  
A mild positive flicker is followed by a stretch of shallow negatives.  Then, beginning in the low fifties, the trace accelerates steeply upward to its dominant summit near index 63.  It glides back down, crossing the axis in the low seventies, and continues into negatives for a considerable span.  Much later it rallies into a broader but decidedly lower secondary hill whose top lies near index 149, after which the curve subsides smoothly into a broad, gently rippling negative shelf that endures to the finish.  
Best-matching class: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens with a brief dip just below zero, then climbs through a mildly jagged positive ramp that crests decisively at about index 14 – by far the tallest point of the record.  From there the trace steps downward through a pair of noticeably smaller humps (the clearer ones sit near indices 42 and 67), drifts across the zero line in the low seventies and slides into an exceptionally long, almost motionless negative shelf.  Apart from low-amplitude noise that never rises above the baseline, nothing disturbs this flat trench to the end.  
Best-matching class: class_11  

Signal 2  
A tiny positive blip at the very start is quickly overtaken by a broad, shallow negative basin that stretches into the mid-sixties.  The curve then rockets upward, reaching a strong summit around index 71, drops back through zero, and after only a short lull climbs once more to a second peak – a shade higher but narrower – centred near index 160.  From that point it declines and settles into a wide, gently sloping negative plain where only minute ripples remain.  
Best fit: clearly follows the general pattern of class 1 (main peak ≈ 76 followed by a much smaller bump ≈ 164), although the second crest is a little larger than “small” in the template.

Signal 3  
Beginning in light negatives with a brief flicker above the axis, the series drifts fractionally lower before launching a steep ascent that tops out at its dominant summit close to index 63.  It glides downward, crosses zero in the early seventies, then rises again into a broader but distinctly lower hill peaking near index 149.  Finally the trace eases into a deep, almost constant negative shelf, broken only by faint, low-frequency oscillations.  
Best-matching class: class_8  (alternative that also fits reasonably well: class 3)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens just a whisker below zero, then hurtles upward in a rapid, almost uninterrupted climb that reaches its dominant crest near index 14.  From there the trace slides back through a shallow mid-level dip, rebounds into a clearly lower secondary hump around index 42, and thereafter dwindles in a succession of ever-weaker ripples.  It crosses the zero line for good in the seventies and drifts off into a long, very flat, gently declining negative stretch that persists to the end.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
A brief positive blip at the very start gives way to a mild glide that bottoms out in the mid-thirties.  The series then surges upward to an initial peak centred on about index 70, slips back across zero into a broad, rather deep negative shelf, and lingers there before beginning a second, longer ascent.  That later climb carries the curve to its overall maximum near index 158, after which it eases downward once more and eventually levels out into an extended, low-amplitude negative terrace.  
Best-matching class: class_4  (class 5 would be an outside alternative, but the later, higher summit favours class 4)  

Signal 3  
Starting with a tiny step above the axis, the curve sinks into a fairly long, shallow negative basin.  It then rockets sky-ward to its principal summit close to index 63, slides back down through zero into a broad, almost level negative plateau, and—apart from a shorter, noticeably lower after-bump peaking near index 171—spends the rest of its course as a gently undulating, near-constant negative shelf.  
Best-matching class: class_1

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens a touch below zero, surges in a swift climb to its dominant summit around index 14, then slides back down through dwindling positives to hover near the zero line. After a shallow dip it pops up into a modest secondary ridge centred near index 42 and a still smaller swell close to index 67. From there it sinks through zero and stretches out into a long, gently declining negative plain broken only by low-amplitude ripples.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
A brief positive blip at the very start is followed by a mild negative drift that bottoms out early on. The trace then sweeps upward to an initial peak at about index 71, drops away into a deep, broad negative plateau, and later launches a stronger second ascent that reaches the overall maximum near index 148. After this highest crest it subsides once more into a protracted, lightly undulating negative shelf.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
The curve begins with a tiny nudge above zero, dips into a fairly long shallow negative basin, and then rockets upward to its main summit close to index 63. It descends again, crosses zero into a modest trough, climbs into a broader but lower hill centred roughly on index 152, and finally fades into an extended, nearly flat negative terrace with only faint oscillations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1 – description  
The trace begins just below zero, then vaults almost straight up to its principal summit near index 14. From there it tumbles into a mid-level dip, recovers into a much smaller hump around index 42, and thereafter slips through progressively weaker oscillations toward a broad, gently sloping negative terrace that continues with only low-amplitude noise to the end.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2 – description  
A modest positive opening quickly gives way to a shallow slide that settles into a long negative shelf. From this floor the curve bursts upward to an early peak near index 69, subsides all the way into its deepest negative plateau, then drives higher still to its overall crest at about index 159, after which it eases downward, flattening into a lengthy, lightly fluctuating sub-zero table.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

signal 3 – description  
Starting in weak negatives and dipping fractionally lower, the series accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies close to index 63, glides down toward zero, swings up again into a broader but lower hill peaking near index 148, and finally declines into a long, almost level negative shelf punctuated by minor undulations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It kicks off a shade below zero, then vaults almost straight up into its dominant summit at about index 14.  From there it slides steadily back down toward the baseline, dips just under zero, bounces up into a much smaller knoll centred near index 41, shows one more modest swell around index 69 that is still far lower than the first, and thereafter trickles away into an extended, almost flat negative shelf disturbed only by very low-amplitude noise.  
Best-matching class: class_2

Signal 2  
A brief positive flicker at the very start is followed by a gentle drift into a shallow negative trough that persists for dozens of samples.  The trace then explodes upward, reaching an initial high point close to index 71, before rolling back down through zero into a broad sub-zero terrace.  Gathering strength once more, it climbs to its overall highest crest in the neighbourhood of index 155, and finally relaxes downward into a long-lasting, lightly rippled negative plateau.  
Best-matching class: class_4

Signal 3  
Beginning in faintly negative territory, the curve idles for a short span and then rockets sky-ward to its main peak near index 59.  It glides back down, crossing zero into a gently falling negative stretch, later arches upward again into a broader but lower hill whose top sits around index 120, and ultimately subsides into a deep, almost constant negative shelf mottled with tiny undulations.  
Best fit: class_8  (also resembles class_3, but the two-peak ordering and later indices line up slightly better with class_8)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
From a brief dip just below zero the curve surges almost straight up, topping out at its dominant summit close to index 14.  It then glides back down toward the baseline, rises into a modest mid-level bump around index 42, lifts once more to a broader yet still lower crest near index 67, and thereafter ebbs through small, ever-weaker undulations into a long, gently slanting negative plain.

Best–matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
After a short positive blip the series slides into a shallow negative trough that bottoms out near index 17.  It then climbs smartly to an initial peak around index 69, drops back through zero into a fairly deep negative shelf, powers up again to reach its overall maximum close to index 148, and finally eases downward into a protracted, lightly noisy negative band.

Best–matching class: class_4  (class 1 would be the next-closest alternative)  

signal 3  
The trace opens in mild negatives with a quick flicker above zero, then rockets upward into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 62.  It plunges back through zero, swells into a broader but appreciably lower hill peaking about index 120, and eventually subsides into a long, almost level negative plateau peppered with faint ripples.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
A tiny dip below zero is followed by a rapid, almost ballistic climb to the dominant summit at about index 14.  From there the curve slides down through a shallow mid-level hollow and rebounds to a clearly lower hump centred near index 42, then lifts once more to an only modest swell around index 67.  After drifting downward it slips through zero in the low seventies and settles into an extended, gently undulating negative terrace that persists to the end.  
Matched class: class_11  (best overall fit; class_2 would be a distant second).

signal 2  
The trace opens with a short positive blip, then glides into an early decline that bottoms out in the mid-twenties to thirties.  Next comes a strong climb that reaches an initial crest near index 69, after which the series rolls back through zero into a broad negative bench.  A second, longer ascent carries the signal to its highest peak around index 157.  From that apex it eases downward and eventually stretches out as a low-amplitude, slowly drifting negative shelf.  
Matched class: class_4  (the only template whose “higher-second-peak” pattern matches).

signal 3  
Beginning in weak negatives, the curve accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies close to index 63.  It then plunges back through zero, rises again into a wider but noticeably lower hill peaking near index 108, and finally decays into a long, nearly flat negative plateau marked only by minor ripples.  
Matched class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1: It opens a hair below zero, fires almost immediately into a quick, very steep ascent that tops out in its dominant summit around index 14. From there the trace slides back down, crossing through a small positive ledge and dipping slightly negative. It rebounds to a modest shoulder centred near index 42, pauses and then reaches an even smaller ridge close to index 61, after which it drifts downward, crosses zero for good and settles into a long, broad, nearly flat negative plain broken only by low-amplitude noise.

Best-matching class: class_2


signal 2: After a brief positive blip the curve sinks gently, bottoming in a shallow negative trough near index 30. It then races upward to an initial peak at about index 70, slips right back into a deep negative plateau, and later bursts out again in a still sharper climb that achieves the overall maximum near index 148. From that high point it eases downward once more, finally spreading out into an extended, quietly undulating negative shelf.

Best-matching class: class_4


signal 3: Starting in light negatives, the series accelerates into a tall, narrow mountain whose apex sits near index 63. It then plunges through zero, coasts into a broader but clearly lower hill peaking around index 140, and afterward decays steadily, ending in a long, almost level negative terrace with only faint ripples.

Best-matching class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens a touch below the zero line, turns immediately upward and, after a short wavering climb, erupts into its tallest mountain whose apex sits close to index 14. From there the trace glides downward in a series of gentle shelves, touches the negative side in the low thirties, then pops back up into a clearly smaller ridge that tops out near index 42. A further, still weaker swell crests around index 67, after which the curve sinks for good, crossing zero in the seventies and flattening into a broad, almost motionless negative plain that stretches to the end with only tiny, low-amplitude ripples.  
Best-matching class: class_11

Signal 2  
The series starts just above zero, slides quickly into a shallow negative trough that lasts for dozens of points, and then heaves itself into a sizeable—but not yet ultimate—summit centred around index 71. It slips back through zero and spends a short spell in modest negatives before mounting a second, higher-than-before peak at about index 162. From that high-point it ebbs steadily downward, finally parking itself on a long, gently deepening negative shelf punctuated only by small monotone jitters.  
Best-matching class: class_4  (class_1 would be the next-closest alternative, but the order and relative size of the two peaks favour class_4)

Signal 3  
Beginning as a nearly level mild-negative plateau, the trace explodes into its principal crest at roughly index 62, then rolls back down across zero into a shallow dip. A mid-sized second hill rises around index 118, conspicuously lower than the first but still well above the baseline. Thereafter the curve drifts downward and slowly settles into a steady, lightly noisy negative table that persists to the finish.  
Best-matching class: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens with a tiny dip below zero and then sweeps almost immediately into a vigorous climb that crests in its highest summit at about index 14.  From that pinnacle the trace slides downward, first fairly steeply and then more gently, grazing zero in the low-thirties.  After hovering close to the axis it flicks up into a modest hump near index 42, dips again, and produces one further, slightly larger but still clearly secondary rise centred on roughly index 67.  Passing through zero in the early seventies it continues into an extended descent that settles into a broad, nearly flat negative plain where only low-amplitude rustling is visible to the end.  
best matching class: class_11  

signal 2  
Beginning with a brief positive blip that is quickly lost, the series sinks into a shallow negative trough lasting into the mid-sixties.  It then accelerates into a sharp first peak around index 68.  This is followed by a brisk fall that pushes the curve well below zero, forming a wide negative table that stretches through the one-hundred-thirties.  Out of this table the trace mounts a second and still higher crest near index 155, which becomes the overall maximum.  From there it eases downward once more, crossing the axis and settling into a long, quietly declining negative shelf peppered with small ripples.  
best matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
A mild positive flicker in the opening moments is quickly replaced by a run of modest negatives.  Around index 50 the curve tilts upward in a steep ramp that culminates in its dominant summit close to index 63.  The subsequent slide carries it back toward and through zero, and by the mid-seventies it is resting on a broad negative ledge.  Later, beginning in the high-140s, the series arches into a noticeably lower second hill whose apex lies near index 153, after which it descends smoothly into a long, almost level negative terrace with only minor undulations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Opening just below zero, the trace bolts upward in a swift, almost uninterrupted climb that culminates in its commanding summit around index 14.  From there it slides down through a mid-level hollow, pushes back up into a clearly smaller hill centred near index 42, and then drains away through progressively weaker ripples until it settles on a broad, gently declining negative shelf that lasts to the end.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
A brief early positive blip is followed by a mild slide that bottoms out near index 37.  The curve then surges to an initial peak close to index 69, slips all the way into a deep, rather flat sub-zero terrace, climbs again—this time higher—to reach its overall summit around index 157, and finally eases downward into a long-lasting, lightly noisy negative band.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
The series begins on a shallow negative ledge with only a tiny early uptick, then rockets upward into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 63.  It plunges back through zero into a modest trough, rises once more to a broader but lower hill peaking around index 118, and thereafter decays gradually into a sustained, nearly constant negative plain with minor undulations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens just a shade below zero, then vaults almost immediately into a rapid, very steep climb that reaches its dominant summit close to index 14.  From there it glides back toward the baseline, hovers for a short while, rises only to a modest shoulder around index 41 and a slightly larger but still clearly secondary crest near index 68, and finally sinks through zero into a long, almost level negative table whose only activity is a faint low-amplitude rustle.  
Matches best: class_2  

signal 2  
A tiny positive blink at the very beginning gives way to a long, shallow negative basin that stretches through the first sixty-odd points.  The curve then rockets upward to a high, clear-cut peak at about index 70, drops back into an extensive, nearly flat negative shelf, throws up one more smaller hump centred roughly on index 158, and thereafter settles into a gently undulating low-negative plain.  
Matches best: class_1  

signal 3  
Following a brief mild-positive flicker the series drifts below zero, then charges up a single, steep ramp that tops out in its highest crest near index 63.  It slopes back down across zero, rolls into negative values, lifts into a noticeably lower but broad secondary swell around index 156, and eventually flattens into a wide, quietly fluctuating negative terrace.  
Matches best: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace starts a touch below zero, shoots upward in a fast, near-exponential climb to its dominant crest roughly at index 14, then slides down into a mid-level dip. It bounces to a clearly smaller hill near index 42 and, after a still lower ripple around index 67, drifts downward, crosses zero and fades through ever-weaker undulations into a long, gently declining negative plain with only low-amplitude noise.  
→ best matches class_2  

signal 2  
A brief positive blip opens the record, after which the curve sinks into a shallow negative basin that bottoms near index 37. It then surges to a first, moderate summit around index 71, drops all the way back into a deep sub-zero plateau, and mounts a stronger second climb that reaches the overall maximum close to index 158. From there it descends steadily, recrosses zero and settles onto an extended, lightly rippled negative shelf.  
→ best matches class_4  

signal 3  
The series begins in weak negatives, punctuated by a tiny positive flicker at index 1, and stays subdued until a steep ascent propels it to its main peak near index 63. It plunges back through zero into a short negative trough, rises again into a broader but lower hill whose top sits around index 132, and then subsides into a long, nearly level negative terrace sprinkled with minor oscillations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It slips only slightly below zero at the very beginning, then bursts almost immediately into a steep climb that tops out at its dominant summit around index 14.  From there it glides downward, crossing the zero line, touches a shallow dip, bounces into a clearly smaller hill centred near index 42, and after one more modest swell close to index 67 slides away into an extended, gently declining negative reach that stays near a low, almost flat level for the rest of the record.  
Best matching class: class_2  (alternative that fits reasonably well: class_11)

signal 2  
A small early positive is followed by a modest slide that bottoms in the mid-thirties.  The trace then surges to its first crest near index 70, drops all the way into a broad negative plain, and, after lingering there, climbs again—this time higher—to its overall apex around index 158.  From that second, dominant peak it eases steadily downward and finishes on a long, lightly rippled negative terrace.  
Best matching class: class_4

signal 3  
Beginning with low-amplitude negatives, the curve rockets upward to a steep main mountain whose peak lies close to index 63.  It plunges back through zero into a shallow trough, rises once more into a broader though distinctly lower hill peaking near index 148, and then decays smoothly into a long, nearly level negative shelf punctuated only by minor undulations.  
Best matching class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Starting a hair below the axis, the trace jogs upward through a few modest humps and then vaults to its unquestioned high-point near index 14.  From that crest it meanders downward, throwing off two lesser knolls around indices 42 and 67, and finally sinks for good below zero in the low-seventies.  Beyond that crossing it glides ever farther into the red, settling into a long, almost featureless negative plain whose only activity is low-amplitude background noise.  
→ best matches class_11 (alternative, but less exact: class_2)

signal 2  
A brief opening flicker above zero is followed by a gentle slide that bottoms in the mid-thirties.  The record then surges to its first mountain, peaking near index 70, slips back through zero into a broad sub-zero shelf, and launches a still larger second summit centred about index 158.  From that ultimate crest it drains away, flattening into an extended, quietly undulating negative terrace.  
→ best matches class_4

signal 3  
The curve begins in mild negatives, accelerates into a sharp climb that reaches its tallest pinnacle around index 62, plunges back past the mid-line, rises once more into a broader yet lower hill topping out near index 110, and finally declines into a long, nearly level negative shelf mottled with faint ripples.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
After a tiny dip below zero it shoots upward in a fast, almost straight climb to its dominant crest around index 14, then glides down through a sequence of still-positive terraces, finally dropping very briefly below the axis in the low-thirties.  It hums close to the baseline, lifts into a modest hump at about index 42 and, a little later, into a slightly larger but clearly secondary rise peaking near index 67.  From the low-seventies onward the trace sinks for good, flattening into a long, gently undulating negative plain that persists to the end.  
best-matching class: class_11           

signal 2  
A small opening blip gives way to a slow downward drift that settles into a broad, mid-depth negative basin.  Beginning in the mid-sixties the curve surges in a long climb to an intermediate summit close to index 70, slides back across the axis into another negative stretch, then, after a lengthy lull, embarks on a second and steeper ascent that reaches the overall maximum near index 158.  From that high-point it slides steadily down and eventually levels out on an extended, lightly noisy negative shelf.  
best-matching class: class_4           

signal 3  
The series starts almost level but slightly negative, gives a brief twitch above zero, then runs flat in shallow negatives until a sudden, steep ascent lifts it to its highest peak around index 63.  It rolls down past zero into a modest trough, climbs again to a noticeably lower, broader hill centred near index 156, and finally fades away into a long, quietly rippling negative table.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It begins a shade below zero, bolts upward in one rapid sweep to its overriding summit near index 14, slides back down through a middling dip, rises only to a noticeably smaller hump about index 42 (with a still lesser after-bump roughly at 67), and then ebbs away through ever–diminishing ripples into a long, gently falling negative plain.  
→ best matches class_2

signal 2  
A brief early positive flicker is followed by a descent that bottoms out in the mid-thirties; the curve then powers up to a first, mid-sized crest around index 69, slips back below zero into a broad negative shelf, climbs once more to its highest peak close to index 158, and finally subsides gradually into an extended, lightly noisy negative plateau.  
→ best matches class_4 (alternative that is somewhat similar: class_7)

signal 3  
The trace opens with a modest positive twitch that soon drops beneath zero, then rockets in one steep ramp to its tallest summit near index 63; it rolls downward again, crossing into a wide negative terrace, lifts into a clearly lower secondary swell centred about index 155, and thereafter drifts off into a broad, almost level negative table mottled by low-amplitude noise.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens a touch below zero, then races upward until it reaches its dominant summit at about index 14.  A quick fall brings the curve back to the vicinity of zero, where it forms a shallow trough, before rising again to a much smaller secondary hill centred near index 42.  From there it weakens progressively, the oscillations shrinking until the trace settles into a long, slowly sagging negative terrace with only faint low-amplitude noise.  
→ best match: class_2  

signal 2  
A brief positive blip is followed by an early slide that bottoms out in the mid-thirties.  The series then launches into a strong climb that tops out in a first, intermediate-sized peak around index 69, drops back through zero into a broad negative basin, and surges once more—this time to its overall maximum close to index 158.  After this highest crest it drifts downward, eventually flattening into a wide, gently fluctuating negative shelf.  
→ best match: class_4  

signal 3  
Starting in mild negatives and dipping a little farther, the curve sweeps upward into its tallest mountain whose apex lies near index 63.  It slides back through zero, hesitates in a shallow valley, then lifts again into a broader but distinctly lower hill peaking around index 150.  Finally the trace subsides smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative plateau punctuated only by tiny ripples.  
→ best match: class_8

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1 – description  
The trace opens just below zero, launches almost immediately into a brisk climb that tops out in its principal pinnacle at about index 14, then drops back toward the baseline and even slips fractionally negative around the low-thirties.  After a brief rebound that crests at roughly index 42 and a somewhat larger but still clearly secondary hump near index 67, it heads downward, crosses firmly into negative terrain near index 100 and thereafter extends into a long, nearly level negative plain whose only features are low-amplitude ripples.  
Best–matching class: class_2  (main crest very early, a smaller hill a little later, followed by a prolonged negative tail).

signal 2 – description  
Beginning with a modest positive blip, the curve sinks into a mild trough that bottoms in the first few dozen points.  It then races upward to a noticeable but not ultimate peak around index 69, slides back through zero into a broad, fairly deep negative stretch, and later mounts an even higher summit – the overall maximum – close to index 156.  From there it slopes steadily downward and finally settles into a wide, gently noisy negative plateau.  
Best–matching class: class_4  (small early peak, deep mid-course dip, highest crest later, then long negative shelf).  A looser alternative would be class 7, but the relative sizes of the two peaks (the second being higher) favour class 4.

signal 3 – description  
The series starts with a faint flicker above zero but quickly drifts negative.  After lingering in shallow sub-zero values, it accelerates in a single steep run that reaches its dominant summit very near index 63.  It then glides downward, slipping below zero in the mid-seventies, and eventually levels out in a negative shelf.  Part-way through that shelf it lifts into a clearly smaller secondary swell centred near index 150 before sinking again into an extended, low-noise negative terrace that persists to the end.  
Best–matching class: class_5  (modest positive opening, tallest summit in the mid-sixties, distinctly smaller second bump in the 140s, long negative finish).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens a touch below zero, shoots almost immediately into a brisk climb that culminates in its principal summit near index 14, then slides steeply down through a mid-level hollow.  A rebound lifts it to a noticeably smaller hill centred around index 41, after which the trace dwindles through ever weaker ripples and finally drifts into a long, gently declining negative plain with only low-amplitude noise.  
Best‐matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
After a brief positive blip the curve drifts downward, bottoming out in a broad shallow negative trough.  It then surges to an initial peak about index 71, falls back to a deep, fairly flat sub-zero table, and mounts a second, clearly higher crest close to index 162 before easing away into a sustained, lightly fluctuating negative shelf.  
Best‐matching class: class_4  (class 7 is a distant alternative, but the later, clearly higher second peak favours class 4)  

Signal 3  
The series starts in mild negatives, gathers speed into a steep ascent whose apex lies near index 63, plunges back through zero, rises once more into a broader but decidedly lower hill peaking around index 114, and finally decays into an extended, almost level negative terrace marked only by small undulations.  
Best‐matching class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Starting just below zero, the curve shoots upward in a rapid stair-step climb that culminates in its principal summit near index 14.  It then slides back toward the baseline, dips slightly negative, and rebounds first to a small crest around index 42 and again to a somewhat larger—but still clearly secondary—swell whose top lies close to index 67.  From there it drifts down through zero and settles into an extended, gently declining negative plain marked only by low-amplitude ripples.  
Best matching class: class_2

Signal 2  
The trace opens a little above the axis and immediately sinks into a long, quietly wavy negative basin that lasts into the mid-sixties.  A vigorous, almost linear ascent then propels it to a high peak near index 69.  It eases downward through positive territory, crosses zero into another broad, flat negative shelf, and mounts a second sizeable (in fact fractionally higher) crest centred roughly at index 157.  After that it slips back into a wide, lightly noisy negative plateau that persists to the end.  
Best matching class: class_1  (alternate but poorer fit: class_9)

Signal 3  
Beginning in weak negatives with only a brief early flicker upward, the series accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex is reached near index 63.  It plunges back through zero, lingers in a shallow negative trough, and then rises again into a broader yet appreciably lower hill that peaks around index 150.  Finally it decays into a long, almost level negative shelf punctuated by minor low-level undulations.  
Best matching class: class_3  (alternate: class_8)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
From a tiny sub-zero opening it hurtles upward, reaching its clear-cut dominant summit at about index 14, then drops all the way back to the neighbourhood of zero.  After that dip it bounces to a modest shoulder near index 42, pauses, and climbs once more to a still lower secondary crest around index 67.  Thereafter the series slides steadily downward, the oscillations becoming ever weaker until they merge into a broad, gently sloping negative plain that persists to the end.  
Best overall fit: class_2  

signal 2  
The trace starts with a small positive blip, glides into a shallow negative basin that bottoms out in the thirties, and then sweeps upward to an initial peak near index 71.  It retreats through zero into a fairly deep negative shelf, but only temporarily: a more powerful second surge carries the curve to its highest summit—around index 158—before it rolls off and subsides into a long, low-lying, lightly rippled negative plateau.  
Best overall fit: class_4  

signal 3  
Beginning in weak negatives, the curve rockets into a steep mountain whose apex lies close to index 63, plunges sharply back below zero, and then rises again into a broader yet distinctly lower hill peaking near index 135.  From there it decays gradually into an extended, almost flat negative shelf punctuated by minor undulations.  
Best overall fit: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Opening a shade below zero, the trace shoots almost straight up to its dominant summit around index 14, then slides back toward the baseline.  A light undulatory stretch follows, out of which a modest shoulder rises near index 42.  After another dip it musters one last, slightly larger but still clearly secondary hill centred roughly at index 67.  From there it drifts downward through a long series of ever–weaker ripples that merge into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.  
Matched class: class_2  

Signal 2  
A small positive flicker is quickly replaced by a gentle slide that bottoms out in the mid-thirties.  The curve then drives upward to a sizeable – but not ultimate – crest near index 69, rolls down through zero into a broad negative bench, and launches a second, even higher surge whose apex lies close to index 157.  Thereafter it eases back and stretches out as a low-lying, lightly noisy negative shelf for the remainder of the record.  
Matched class: class_4  

Signal 3  
After a few tentative positive ticks that sink into shallow negatives, the signal races sky-ward in a single steep ramp to its highest peak at about index 63.  It then slopes downward through zero, levelling briefly before raising a clearly lower, broader swell centred near index 147.  Finally the curve subsides into a wide, gently fluctuating negative plain that persists to the end.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens a touch below zero, then vaults almost straight upward into its principal summit near index 14. From that high point it slides back to a shallow positive dip, rebounds to a clearly smaller hill at about index 42 and raises an only slightly higher hump around index 67. Thereafter the trace drains slowly through zero in the low seventies and settles into an extended, gently declining negative stretch whose surface is broken only by very small ripples.  
→ best match: class_2  

signal 2  
A brief early positive blip gives way to a mild descent that bottoms out close to index 37. From that floor the curve climbs to an initial peak near index 69, sinks completely into a broad deep-negative terrace, then mounts a second, decidedly higher crest around index 158. After that high point it subsides steadily into a long, almost flat negative band with only low-amplitude noise.  
→ best match: class_4  

signal 3  
Beginning with a modest positive flicker that soon dips below zero, the series launches into a single steep ramp whose absolute summit lies at index 63. It then slopes downward, crosses zero near index 73, and continues into the negatives. A noticeably lower secondary swell rises around index 172 before the curve finally flattens into a wide, lightly undulating negative plain.  
→ best match: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Starting with a brief dip fractionally below zero, the trace shoots upward through several jagged rungs until it reaches its dominant summit at about index 14.  From that high-point it steps downward through progressively lower humps – the most noticeable small tops sit near indices ≈42 and ≈67 – and at the beginning of the seventies it slides beneath the axis.  The remainder of the record is a long, very flat negative plain whose only decoration is light, low-amplitude noise.  
Best fitting class: class_11  

Signal 2  
The curve opens with a mild positive flicker and then glides down to a shallow trough that bottoms close to index 37.  It rebounds sharply to a first, moderate peak around index 69, falls away into an extended sub-zero plateau, and then launches a second, higher climb that culminates in its overall maximum near index 157.  After that crest it relaxes gradually into a broad, gently undulating negative shelf that lasts to the finish.  
Best fitting class: class_4  

Signal 3  
A modest early uptick is quickly lost as the series slips below zero; after that lull it embarks on a single steep ascent that tops out at its tallest summit near index 63.  The trace then slopes downward, crosses the axis in the low seventies, and settles briefly into negative territory before lifting once more into a secondary but distinctly smaller hill centred around index 150.  Finally it drifts back through zero and comes to rest on a wide, only lightly rippled negative terrace.  
Best fitting class: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens a fraction below zero, launches into a swift climb that tops out in its dominant crest near index 14, slides down through a shallow dip, bounces up to a modest hill around index 42, dips briefly sub-zero again and raises one last, still smaller hump near index 67.  From there it ebbs away through steadily weakening ripples into a long, gently declining negative plateau.  
Best‐matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
The trace begins with a short positive flick, sinks into a rather broad negative basin that reaches its floor in the upper teens, then drives upward to a first sizeable crest close to index 70.  After a renewed descent deep into negative territory it embarks on a longer rise that attains the overall maximum near index 150, after which the curve eases downward and stretches out as a low, lightly fluctuating negative shelf.  
Best‐matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
Following a brief early uptick the series dives below zero, then surges in a steep ramp that reaches its highest summit around index 64.  It slopes back toward and through zero, climbs once more to a clearly lower secondary peak near index 122, and finally subsides into a broad, nearly level negative plain dotted with tiny oscillations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens a fraction below the baseline, then launches almost straight upward through a train of ever-higher ripples to its one dominant summit at about index 14.  From there it slides back toward zero, dips slightly underneath, pops up into a modest bump near index 42 and into a still smaller swell around index 67, before slipping definitively below the axis in the mid-seventies.  The remainder is a long, quietly undulating negative shelf that deepens only very gradually and contains nothing more than low-amplitude noise.  
Best-matching class: class_11 (class_2 would also be plausible but its later structure fits less well).

signal 2  
A brief positive blip is followed by a gentle early slide that bottoms out in the mid-teens.  The curve then climbs to a first, intermediate crest near index 69, falls back into a broad negative plain, and later powers up to its overall maximum—much higher than the first crest—at roughly index 156.  From that high-point it relaxes steadily downward, crossing the axis and stretching out into a very long, slowly declining, lightly rippled negative terrace.  
Best-matching class: class_4 (class_8 or class_5 resemble certain parts, but only class_4 places the tallest peak after an earlier, smaller one).

signal 3  
Beginning in weak negatives, the series vaults into a steep, narrow mountain whose apex lies close to index 63.  It then plunges back through zero into a shallow trough, rebounds into a broader yet appreciably lower hill peaking around index 151, and finally decays into a prolonged, almost flat negative plateau mottled with small-scale noise.  
Best-matching class: class_3 (class_8 is a secondary possibility, but the pronounced sub-zero plunge between the two hills accords better with class_3).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens a touch below zero, then vaults into a steep, almost uninterrupted climb whose absolute summit is reached very early, around index 14.  From there the trace glides back down, crossing the zero-line and coming to rest on a broad, near–zero shelf.  A distinctly smaller hump lifts the curve for a moment near index 42 and an even weaker ripple appears in the mid-sixties, but thereafter the signal drains away through a sequence of ever­-diminishing oscillations and settles into a long, gently sloping negative stretch that persists to the end.  
Best matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
A brief positive flicker at the very start is followed by a prolonged slide that bottoms out in a fairly flat, mid-negative basin extending to about index 60.  The series then powers upward in a long ramp to a strong crest centred near index 69, slips back toward zero, and falls once more into negative territory.  After this respite it stages another, still steeper surge whose true, overall maximum lies close to index 157.  From that second mountain–top the curve declines steadily, punctuated only by low-amplitude tremors, and finally drifts away on a wide, slowly deepening negative plain.  
This two-step “smaller-first / larger-second” mountain sequence, with the highest peak well past the midpoint and a deep negative floor between the two climbs, most closely resembles (though not perfectly) the pattern described for class_4.  

Signal 3  
The trace begins with a modest positive blip, dips below zero for a short while, and then accelerates into a single, very steep ascent whose dominant summit sits at about index 63.  It then cascades downward, crosses zero near the low seventies and keeps falling into negative ground.  After a lengthy, gently undulating decline it gathers itself once more, producing a clearly lower secondary swell that crests near index 149, before ebbing away into a wide, almost motionless negative shelf peppered with small ripples.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens just below zero, vaults quickly into a sharp, dominant summit around index 14, then drifts downward through a string of ever-smaller positive humps.  A modest rebound appears near index 42 and a slightly larger but still clearly secondary rise centres on index 67, after which the trace slips decisively below zero and stretches out into a long, almost level negative plain broken only by faint low-amplitude noise.  
Best-matching class: class_11   (also resembles class_2, but the later extra bump and the final very flat negative terrace agree better with class 11’s description).

Signal 2  
A brief positive blip is followed by a mild slide that bottoms out (≈index 37).  From there the curve explodes upward to an initial peak at about index 69, retreats across zero into a broad negative shelf, then mounts an even higher crest close to index 157.  Thereafter it glides downward, settling into an extended, gently deepening negative plateau sprinkled with small ripples.  
Best-matching class: class_4

Signal 3  
The series starts in weak negatives, hesitates with small oscillations, and then rockets into a steep mountain whose apex sits near index 63.  It plunges back through zero, climbs once more into a wider but appreciably lower hill peaking around index 148, and finally decays into a long, nearly flat negative shelf with only slight tremors.  
Best-matching class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Starting with a tiny dip below zero, the curve shoots almost straight up to its one true summit near index 14, slips back through a shallow hollow that hovers around the zero line, rises only to a modest hump in the low-forties and an even gentler swell in the mid-sixties, then dissolves into progressively weaker ripples that give way to a long, slowly sagging negative plateau in which only very low-level fluctuations remain.  
Best overall match: class_2  

signal 2  
The series opens a hair above zero and slides into a fairly long but mild negative basin whose lowest point sits in the mid-thirties.  From there it climbs to a first crest around index 69, falls away into a broad deep-negative table, mounts a second and higher peak close to index 158, and finally relaxes downward into an extended, lightly undulating negative shelf.  
Best overall match: class_4 (the only class whose pattern features an initial smaller peak followed by a later dominant summit and a long negative tail).  

signal 3  
After a brief, weakly negative beginning, the trace rockets upward into a steep mountain whose pinnacle lands near index 62, plunges back past zero, rolls into a broader but markedly lower hill that tops out about index 128, and then drains into a lengthy, almost flat negative plain disturbed only by small-amplitude noise.  
Best overall match: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace starts a shade below zero, then climbs briskly through a succession of rising shoulders to its principal summit near index 14.  From that high point it slopes downward through a scatter of ever-smaller crests, the most noticeable of which stand at about indices 42 and 66.  After sliding beneath the axis in the low seventies it never regains real height, instead petering out through low-amplitude ripples into a long, almost motionless negative shelf.  
Best-matching class: class_11  

Signal 2  
A brief opening uptick is followed by a mild early slide that bottoms out in the mid-teens.  The series then surges to an initial, but not yet dominant, peak around index 71, dives into a broad deep negative plateau, and later climbs again to its overall highest crest close to index 159.  From there it eases downward once more, eventually settling on a steady, lightly noisy sub-zero table.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
After a modest positive flicker the curve drifts below zero, pauses, and then accelerates in a single steep ramp to its tallest summit near index 63.  It rolls down across the axis, descends into negative territory, rises again into a distinctly lower secondary swell centred roughly at index 123, and finally decays into a wide, gently undulating negative plain.  
Best-matching class: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It dips a touch below zero at the very first reading, then surges in a steep run-up to its highest crest at about index 14. From there it falls away to a mild mid-level hollow, rebounds to a clearly lower hill centred near index 42, shows one more modest swell a little later around index 67, and thereafter withers through a succession of ever-smaller ripples into a long, gently sloping negative plain that persists to the end.  
best-matching class: class_2 (alternative but poorer fit: class_11)

signal 2  
A brief early positive flicker is followed by a prolonged shallow negative trough. Out of this basin the trace lifts to a substantial, though not extreme, peak close to index 71, slides back down through zero again, then mounts an even larger crest near index 161 before subsiding steadily into a wide, low-amplitude negative terrace peppered with tiny oscillations.  
best-matching class: no convincing match found among the eleven reference classes

signal 3  
After a small positive blip it drops beneath zero and stays there until a single, very steep climb propels it to its dominant summit at roughly index 63. The curve then slopes back down across zero into a negative stretch, arches into a broader but far lower secondary swell centred near index 146, and finally settles onto a broad, almost flat negative shelf with only faint noise.  
best-matching class: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens just below zero, then streaks almost immediately into a sharp climb whose undisputed summit appears at about index 14. From there it glides downward, crossing the axis in the low thirties, bottoms in a shallow mid-level dip, and rebounds to a distinctly smaller knoll around index 42. A last, still weaker hump tops out near index 67 before the trace subsides into a long, gradually declining negative tract that is punctuated only by very slight undulations.  
Best-matching class: class_2

signal 2  
A brief positive blip at the very beginning gives way to a slow slide that settles into mildly negative ground through the forties and fifties. The series then sweeps upward into its first real crest near index 69, slips back through zero into a broad negative trough, and mounts a second—and this time highest—crest centred close to index 158. After that the curve eases steadily downward, levelling off into an extended, gently fluctuating negative shelf that persists to the end.  
Best-matching class: class_4  (a reasonable secondary fit would be class_7)

signal 3  
Starting in light negatives with a tiny early uptick, the signal accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex is reached near index 63. It plunges back through zero in the low seventies, then rises once more into a broader but clearly lower hill peaking around index 152, after which it drifts away into a long, almost flat negative terrace marked only by low-amplitude noise.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It begins a shade below zero, then shoots almost straight up into its supreme crest at about index 14.  From there it glides steadily downward, brushing zero in the mid-thirties, lifts into a modest after-bump near index 41 and a slightly broader but still lower swell centred close to index 69, and thereafter ebbs through ever weaker ripples before settling into a long, gently sinking negative terrace with only low-level noise.  
best matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
The trace opens with a brief positive blip, drops quickly through zero into an extended shallow negative hollow that lasts into the sixties, then vaults to a first peak around index 69.  It slides back down to a broad sub-zero shelf, gathers strength again and climbs to its overall summit near index 158 – higher than the first crest – after which it slackens smoothly and drifts away in a wide, mildly noisy negative plain.  
best matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
Starting just under zero, it sags a little further into negative territory before erupting in a steep ascent that crowns at its dominant maximum near index 63.  The curve then slopes downward across zero into a broad, almost level negative bench, rises only to a much smaller secondary hill roughly at index 151, and finally fades into a long, nearly flat negative plateau sprinkled with tiny undulations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Opening a touch below zero, the trace vaults almost immediately into a fast-rising ramp that tops out at its overall summit near index 14.  It then slides steadily back through the upper positives, crosses the zero line in the low 30 s and sinks into a shallow negative dip.  A rebound lifts it to a modest secondary hill centred around index 41, after which low-amplitude wavering keeps the curve near zero until a third but still smaller swell (≈ index 66).  From there the series drifts downward, flattening into a long, gently declining negative shelf peppered with only slight ripples.  
Best-matching class: class_2

Signal 2  
A brief opening uptick is quickly reversed by a mild descent that bottoms out near index 37.  From that trough the signal climbs to an initial crest at about index 72, then falls all the way into an extended deep-negative plateau.  It next swings upward again, reaching its highest peak close to index 144 before easing back down and dissolving into a wide, low-lying negative terrace with light noise.  
Best-matching class: class_4

Signal 3  
Beginning in weak negatives (aside from a tiny early blip), the curve edges a little lower, then races upward in a steep sweep to its dominant peak around index 61.  It glides downward through progressively smaller positives, passes just below zero in the low 70 s, and rises once more into a broader but lower hill whose apex sits near index 122.  Thereafter it descends smoothly into a deep, almost level negative shelf marked only by faint undulations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening only a hair below the axis, the trace quickly turns upward, racing to its highest pinnacle near index 14.  It then slides back through a shallow, partly sub-zero dip, rebounds to a noticeably lower crest about index 42, and raises one more smallish swell around index 62 before losing energy.  From there it sinks past zero for good and stretches out into a long, gently wavering negative plain whose variations never again reach real prominence.  
→ best fits class_2

signal 2  
The series starts on a modest positive ledge, slumps into an extended negative basin that bottoms out in the mid-thirties, and then climbs to a first, intermediate peak roughly at index 69.  After rolling off that rise it descends into a flat, deep negative plateau, from which it launches a longer, steeper ascent that attains the overall maximum near index 158.  Finally it rolls downward once more, settling into a broad, low-lying negative shelf where only small ripples remain.  
→ best fits class_4

signal 3  
Beginning just below zero with a few tentative wiggles, the curve dips a bit farther and then surges in a steep ramp that reaches its dominant summit around index 62.  It slides back through zero into a mild trough, then arches into a second, clearly lower but broader hill centred near index 128, and thereafter fades into an extended, almost level negative terrace peppered with faint undulations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens a hair below zero, then streaks upward in one uninterrupted rush to its dominant crest at about index 14.  From that height the curve drifts downward through several ever-smaller positive humps – the more noticeable ones sitting near indices 42 and 67 – before slipping beneath zero in the low seventies.  Thereafter it settles onto an extended, almost motionless negative shelf whose surface is broken only by very low-amplitude noise.  
Best-matching template: class_11  

Signal 2  
A small positive blip is followed by a long, shallow descent that bottoms out in the mid-thirties and continues as a subdued sub-zero plain until the mid-sixties.  The trace then shoots up to a first summit close to index 69, falls away into a deep negative trough, re-ascends to its overall maximum around index 156, and finally eases downward into a broad, gently undulating negative plateau.  
Best-matching template: class_4  

Signal 3  
Beginning in weak negatives and remaining almost level, the series suddenly accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex sits near index 63.  It rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again into a wider but distinctly lower hill that peaks around index 148, and then slides away into a long, lightly rippling negative expanse.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It starts a touch below zero, then shoots almost straight up to its principal summit in the mid-teens (peak ≈ index 14).  From there it slides quickly down through a mild dip that bottoms out around the high twenties, bounces back into a noticeably smaller hump at about index 42 and throws in one last, still more modest swell near index 66.  After that it simply drifts lower and lower, settling into a long, quietly undulating negative plain that lasts to the end.  
Best overall match: class_2  

Signal 2  
A brief positive blip at the very beginning gives way to an extended, fairly shallow negative shelf.  Around index 69 the curve surges into a strong first peak, then drops right back through zero into a deep, wide basin.  A second, even higher climb culminates near index 156 in the dominant summit; from there the track eases downward, the remaining movements shrinking into a broad, gently deepening negative terrace with only scattered low-amplitude bumps.  
Best overall match: class_4  (class_1 would be a distant second choice, but the order and relative size of the two peaks fit class_4 better)

Signal 3  
Opening with faint negatives and a tiny early flicker, the series accelerates into its tallest mountain just past index 60.  It then rolls downward, crossing zero into a modest trough, and rises again—this time to a broader but clearly lower hill centred near index 128.  Finally the trace fades away into a long, nearly flat negative shelf broken only by minor ripples.  
Best overall match: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening a touch below the axis, the trace bursts almost straight upward, culminating in its dominant summit at about index 14.  From there it descends steadily, crosses into slight negatives, pops back up to a modest hump around index 42, and—after a last, still smaller swell centred near index 67—slides away through ever-weaker wiggles into a broad, gently declining negative shelf that lasts to the end.  
Matched class: class_2  

signal 2  
A small early positive flicker is followed by a long, nearly level negative terrace.  The curve then undertakes a long climb that tops out in a high crest close to index 69, falls back through zero into another flat negative span, and rises again—this time a little higher—to a second big peak around index 158.  Thereafter it fades once more into an extended, lightly rippled sub-zero plain.  
Matched class: (no existing class fits this double-summit pattern convincingly)  

signal 3  
After a brief dip and tiny positive hiccup, the series sinks slightly below zero, pauses, then lunges sky-ward in a steep ramp that reaches its highest point near index 63.  It slides back down across the axis, settles into a roomy negative stretch, climbs again into a broader but decidedly lower hill whose crown sits near index 149, and finally eases off into a long, almost flat negative table dotted with low-amplitude noise.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace starts with a tiny negative nip, then surges almost immediately into a rapid climb whose absolute summit sits about index 14.  From there it slides down through a gentle sag, lifts into two progressively smaller rebounds centred near indices 42 and 67 (both well below the first peak), and stays on the positive side until the low seventies.  Crossing zero, it drifts downward through ever-weaker ripples and finally settles into a long, nearly level, low-noise negative plateau that lasts to the end.  
→ best fit: class_11  

signal 2  
A brief early positive blip gives way to a mild slide that bottoms out in the late teens, after which the curve rockets upward to an initial crest around index 66.  It then rolls down through zero into a broad, distinctly negative trough, only to power up again into a second, still steeper climb whose overall maximum lies close to index 148.  From that highest peak the series relaxes gradually, dwindling into an extended, gently declining negative band with small-amplitude noise.  
→ best fit: class_4  

signal 3  
The series opens with a small negative dip and a short positive flutter, dips below zero once more, and then races up a single steep ramp to its dominant summit near index 62.  It descends smoothly, crossing zero in the early seventies, climbs again into a noticeably lower and broader secondary hill peaking around index 115, and finally slides into a long, almost flat, lightly undulating negative shelf.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It launches from a hair below zero, streaks upward in a rapid climb to its commanding peak close to index 14, then slides down through a long positive tail that finally dips under the axis.  A brief rebound gives a modest hump near index 42, followed by an even milder rise peaking about index 67.  From there the trace ebbs steadily, spending the rest of its course as a broad, gently sloping negative shelf whose only motion is low-amplitude noise.  
Best matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
A short mildly positive blip is quickly replaced by an extended, almost level negative drift.  Around index 70 the curve erupts into a tall crest, retreats back across zero, but only fifty or so points later sinks again into a shallow trough.  A second, slightly higher summit appears near index 162 before the series subsides once more into a very long, slowly downward-tilting negative terrace mottled with small ripples.  
This overall shape (two comparable high peaks, with the later one the higher) does not fit any of the reference patterns closely enough to justify a confident match.  
Best matching class: none (no close analogue)  

Signal 3  
Opening with faint negatives and a tiny positive twitch, the sequence idles below zero until it fires into a single steep ramp that tops out at its major summit around index 63.  It then glides back down through the axis into negative territory, where it lingers until a much smaller swell crests near index 159.  After that the curve settles into a broad, quietly fluctuating negative plain.  
Best matching class: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Opening just a whisker below zero, the trace soars almost immediately into a steep climb that tops out at its dominant summit near index 14. From there it slides down through a mid-level dip, rebounds into a noticeably smaller hill centred on about index 42, shows an even tinier after-bump close to index 67, and then ebbs away through progressively weaker oscillations until it settles on a long, gently descending negative shelf with only low-amplitude noise.  
BEST MATCH : class_2  

Signal 2  
A brief positive blip at the very start gives way to a gentle slide that bottoms in the mid-thirties. The series then surges to an initial crest around index 69, falls back into a broad deep negative plateau, and mounts a second, taller and final summit—the overall maximum—near index 157. Thereafter it drifts downward once more, fading into an extended, lightly rippled negative terrace.  
BEST MATCH : class_4  (class_9 is a distant alternative, but the two-crested pattern with the higher second peak fits class_4 more closely.)  

Signal 3  
The curve begins in weak negatives with a tiny early uptick, then accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 63. It plunges back through zero into negative territory, rises again into a broader but appreciably lower hill that peaks around index 153, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf pock-marked by only minor undulations.  
BEST MATCH : class_3  (class_8 is a reasonable second choice, yet the clear passage back through zero between the two hills is more typical of class_3.)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It begins a shade below zero, then shoots up in a rapid climb that tops out at its dominant summit near index 14.  From there it rolls down into a mid-level dip, bounces up to a modest hill around index 42, lifts a little higher to a still-smaller secondary crest close to index 64, and thereafter ebbs away through progressively weaker wiggles into a broad, gently declining negative plain.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
After a brief positive blip the line drifts lower, bottoming in a shallow negative basin a little before the mid-thirties.  It then surges to its first peak near index 68, slides back into a fairly long sub-zero stretch, and climbs once more—this time to its highest crest centred around index 148.  From that apex it eases downward, settling into a wide, lightly fluctuating negative shelf.  
Best-matching class: class_4  (class_1 is a distant alternative, but the stronger second peak favours class_4)  

signal 3  
The trace opens in mild negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 63, dives back through zero, rises again into a broader but lower hill peaking about index 110, and finally fades into an extended, almost flat negative terrace marked only by small undulations.  
Best-matching class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening a touch below zero, the series shoots almost straight upward, reaching its dominant summit near index 14.  It then slides back toward the baseline, dipping just under it around the mid-forties, pops up into a modest hump close to index 42 and an only slightly larger after-shock at about index 67, and finally sinks decisively below zero in the early seventies.  From there on it drifts downward into a long, almost motionless negative plain broken only by very small-amplitude flickers.  
matched class: class_11  

signal 2  
A small initial positive blip is followed by a fairly gentle slide that bottoms out in the mid-thirties, after which the trace surges into its first clear peak around index 71.  The line then rolls down through zero into a broad, rather flat negative terrace, stays there for many tens of points, and eventually climbs again, this time to its overall crest near index 160.  Once that second—now highest—summit is passed, the curve eases back into a long, quietly undulating sub-zero shelf.  
matched class: class_4  (reasonably close; class 7 would be the second-best alternative)  

signal 3  
The curve starts in weak negatives, then accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies close to index 63.  It plunges back through zero, rises again into a wider but distinctly lower hill peaking near index 147, and at last decays into a very long, barely changing negative platform that bears only faint ripples.  
matched class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens just below zero, then races upward in a steady, almost uninterrupted climb that reaches its highest summit near index 14.  From there the trace glides back toward the baseline, dips fractionally negative, rebounds to a modest knoll around index 42, slips again and forms a somewhat larger yet still clearly secondary crest close to index 67.  After crossing permanently below zero in the low-seventies it subsides into a long, deep, virtually flat negative plateau where only very slight flickers disturb the line to the end.  
Best-matching class: class_11  

Signal 2  
A small positive blip heralds a gentle slide that bottoms out in the mid-thirties.  The curve then sweeps upward to a sizeable, but not final, peak near index 69, rolls back down through zero into an ample, nearly level negative bench, and at last powers into a second, stronger rise that produces the overall maximum around index 157.  Thereafter it relaxes once more into an extended, lightly rippled negative shelf.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
Following a few low-level wiggles around the origin the series sags mildly negative, then launches into a single steep ramp that tops out at its dominant crest close to index 63.  It slopes down through positive values, settles into a shallow sub-zero stretch, climbs again to a distinctly lower secondary hill centred near index 146, and finally drifts away into a broad, almost constant negative plain punctuated only by faint undulations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace opens a touch below zero, then surges almost immediately through a sequence of positive bumps that climax in the dominant summit at about index 14.  From there it glides downward, dipping under the axis for the first time in the low-thirties, rises only to a modest shoulder near index 42 and to a slightly higher ridge round index 67, then heads steadily southwards, crossing decisively below zero in the early seventies and settling into an extended, nearly flat negative plain broken only by very small oscillations.  
Best match: class_11

signal 2  
A brief early uptick gives way to a gentle slide that bottoms out (about index 37) in a broad negative basin.  The signal then sweeps upward to an initial peak near index 69, sinks back into a deep, almost level negative plateau centred around index 110, climbs again to reach its highest crest close to index 157, and finally drifts downward into a long, slowly flattening negative shelf sprinkled with low-amplitude noise.  
Best match: class_4

signal 3  
After a tiny positive flicker the curve hovers in shallow negatives, then launches into a single steep ascent that attains its tallest summit near index 63.  It slopes back down, crosses zero in the early seventies, and, after a pause, rises into a noticeably lower secondary swell centred about index 141.  From there it descends smoothly into a long, almost constant negative terrace with only faint ripples.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Starting a touch below zero, the trace surges almost immediately into a brisk climb that culminates in its dominant summit at about index 14.  From there it rolls downward through a modest hollow, pops up into a small secondary hill centred near index 42, drifts lower to cross the zero line in the low thirties, then stages one last, clearly smaller crest around index 66.  After that it sinks smoothly into an extended, gently declining negative band marked only by very low-amplitude flicker.  
Best matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
The series opens with a brief positive blip, then sinks into a wide, low-lying negative basin that lasts into the early sixties.  A long, vigorous climb follows, lifting the curve to a strong peak close to index 70.  It drops back below zero, levels out on a deep negative shelf, and—after a prolonged lull—breaks into a second crest that is actually a little higher than the first, centred just before index 160.  The record then subsides once more into a persistent flat-negative terrace.  
No published template really captures this two-high-peaks shape (with the later one the larger), so it does not match any of the eleven classes convincingly.  

Signal 3  
The curve begins in faint negatives with a tiny positive flick at index 1, slides shallowly downward, then rockets upward into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 61.  It plunges back through zero, rises again into a wider but appreciably lower hill peaking around index 125, and finally eases into a long, almost constant negative shelf interrupted only by minor ripples.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens only fractionally below zero, then shoots upward in a brisk climb that culminates in its dominant summit near index 14.  From there the series glides downward through steadily smaller positives, brushes the zero line and spends a short, almost level spell straddling it.  A rebound carries it to a clearly lower hill centred on about index 42; after another brief lull, an even smaller rise arrives close to index 67.  Beyond the high-sixties the curve dips through zero for good and, apart from low-amplitude ripples, settles into an extended, gently sloping negative reach that lasts to the end.  
Best fitting class: class_2

Signal 2  
The trace begins a little above zero but almost immediately slides into a long, shallow negative basin that lasts through the mid-sixties.  It then sweeps upward in a long surge to a broad peak around index 69, slides back through positive values and spends a while in mildly negative territory.  A second climb follows, reaching a slightly higher crest near index 157, after which the signal slopes away and drifts into a wide, slowly deepening negative shelf dotted with very small wiggles.  (This overall shape most closely echoes the “big-mountain-then-smaller-bump” family, but here the second crest is marginally higher; nonetheless the timing of the two crests matches class 1 far better than any other template.)  
Best fitting class: class_1  (alternative that also bears some similarity: class_9)

Signal 3  
After a subdued, slightly negative start with a single brief flick into the positives, the series slips into a shallow trough.  From the low-forties it embarks on a steep, continuous ascent that tops out at its tallest summit near index 63.  A smooth descent through shrinking positives follows, carrying the curve below zero in the mid-seventies.  It resides there for some time, then rallies into a clearly smaller, broader secondary swell peaking around index 146.  Thereafter the trace subsides once more and stretches out as a broad, gently undulating negative plain.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Starting with a tiny dip below zero, the curve rises briskly through a short positive run and shoots to its dominant pinnacle at about index 14.  From that height it slopes away into an almost level, near-zero basin, then ripples upward to a modest hump near index 42 and to a still lower swell around index 67.  After crossing the zero line in the low seventies it glides downward and settles into a long, virtually flat negative shelf punctuated only by very small fluctuations.  
Best-matching class: class_11  (class_2 would also be conceivable, but its second hill ought to be weaker than we see here).

Signal 2  
A brief early positive tick is followed by a gentle slide that bottoms out in the mid-thirties.  The trace then vaults upward to a first peak near index 69, retreats into a broad negative table, and rallies once more—this time reaching its overall summit close to index 157.  From there it drifts downward through zero and stretches out into an extended, lightly undulating negative plateau.  
Best-matching class: class_4

Signal 3  
After some low-amplitude flickers around zero the signal drifts slightly negative, then races up a single steep ramp that reaches its tallest summit at roughly index 63.  It then glides back down, passes below zero in the mid-seventies and spreads into a wide negative plain.  A noticeably smaller, rounded rebound appears near index 152, after which the series subsides into a broad, gently varying negative shelf.  
Best-matching class: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Beginning just shy of zero, the trace rushes upward in a single, fast climb that tops out at its principal summit near index 14.  It then drops into a medium-depth trough, rises again to a clearly smaller ridge centred about index 42, and thereafter dwindles through a sequence of ever-weaker ripples until it settles in a long, gently sagging negative stretch with only low-level noise.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
A brief positive blip opens the record, but it soon slides into a shallow, fairly flat negative hollow that reaches its floor in the mid-thirties.  From there the curve powers up to an initial peak around index 69, slips back into a deep, almost level negative plateau, then launches a second, higher surge that achieves the overall maximum close to index 157.  After that crest it drifts downward again, gradually flattening into a wide, lightly undulating negative shelf.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
The series shows a fleeting early uptick above zero before dipping into mild negatives, then races up a steep ramp that culminates in its dominant pinnacle at index 63.  It slopes back down through positive territory, crosses below zero, and mounts a noticeably lower secondary swell centred near index 155.  Finally it subsides into an expansive, almost flat negative plain broken only by small-amplitude ripples.  
Best-matching class: class_5 (alternative class_3 would also be conceivable, but the index positions and “largest-then-smaller” peak pattern fit class 5 more closely).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens a hair below the axis, then shoots almost immediately into a steep ascent whose commanding crest appears near index 14. From that high point the curve slips back through successively smaller positives and dips fractionally into the negatives around the low-thirties. It rebounds to a modest knoll centred on index 42 and, after a brief levelling, rolls up once more to a minor rise in the upper-sixties before sinking for good. Past index 80 the trace drifts downward, passes well below zero and stretches out into a long, gently declining negative plain disturbed only by very small ripples.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
A brief, low-amplitude positive opening is followed by a mild slide that finds its deepest trough (≈ –0.53) close to index 37. From there the series launches into a vigorous climb that tops out at an initial summit around index 69. It then glides back through zero and spends a few dozen points in a shallow negative shelf before gathering momentum again. The second, and highest, crest is reached near index 157, after which the graph eases downward, crossing the axis once more and settling into a broad, slowly deepening negative platform mottled with tiny undulations that persist to the end.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
Starting with slight negatives that wobble just above and below the axis, the line descends a little further into a shallow basin, then accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex (the overall maximum) stands at index 63. It plunges smartly back through zero, carving out a mid-level negative stretch, and then sweeps upward into a second, broader but clearly lower hill that peaks near index 116. From there it subsides, crosses the axis for the last time and fades into an extended, near-flat negative shelf marked only by low-amplitude noise.  
Best-matching class: class_3  (class 8 would be a plausible alternative)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Beginning just below zero, the trace shoots upward through a cluster of small undulations and crests at its towering maximum near index 14.  It then slides back, brushing a shallow mid-level dip in the low 30 s before rising to a modest hill at index 42 and to a slightly larger—but still clearly secondary—bump around index 67.  From the low 70 s it crosses the axis, loses altitude and, apart from light ripples, settles into an extended, quietly declining negative plateau that stretches to the end.  
Best-matching class: class_11

signal 2  
A brief positive tick is followed by a slow early slide that bottoms out in the mid-30 s and opens into a long, almost level negative plain.  Near index 68 the series heaves upward to a good-sized but not final crest, sinks again into a deep negative shelf, and then, in a second, steeper climb, reaches its overall summit close to index 156.  Thereafter it drifts downward, flattening into a broad, lightly noisy sub-zero terrace.  
Best-matching class: class_4

signal 3  
After a tiny positive blip the curve dips into gentle negatives that persist until the low 50 s.  It then launches in a single, steep ramp to its dominant peak at about index 63, glides down across zero near index 73 and settles into negative ground.  A secondary but much smaller swell rises around index 158, and the trace finally eases off into a wide, faintly undulating negative plain.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The series opens just beneath zero, then drives rapidly upward through a lively positive stretch that culminates in its chief summit near index 14. From that height it glides down through a succession of shrinking ripples, pausing for a modest secondary swell at about index 42 and a slightly larger bump close to index 67. It finally slips below zero in the low-seventies and settles into an extended, almost motionless negative shelf that endures to the finish with only low-amplitude twitching.  
Most consistent class: class_11

signal 2  
After a short flick above zero the trace drifts downward, bottoming out in a shallow negative basin during the first third of the record. It then rockets sky-ward to an initial crest around index 70, slides back through the origin into a wide sub-zero terrace, and launches once more—this time reaching its overall maximum near index 158. From that second, higher summit it eases steadily downward, ending on a broad, gently rippled negative plain.  
Most consistent class: class_4  (the two-peak pattern with the later summit being the taller matches this class best)

signal 3  
The curve begins in mild negatives, hesitates for a few tiny wiggles, then hurtles into a steep mountain whose apex occurs near index 63. It plunges back through zero, climbs again into a broader yet noticeably lower hill peaking around index 128, and finally decays into a long, nearly flat negative shelf marked only by very slight undulations.  
Most consistent class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Starting a shade below zero, the curve shoots almost straight upward to its chief summit near index 14, then slides back toward the baseline, dipping only briefly below it.  A smaller rebound forms a secondary hill at about index 42, after which the trace dwindles through steadily weaker ripples and settles into a long, slowly sinking negative plain with little more than low-amplitude noise.

signal 2  
A tiny early positive bump is followed by a broad, shallow descent that bottoms out in the mid-thirties.  From there the series climbs to a moderate crest centred on index 69, falls away into a deep sub-zero stretch, and then launches a steeper second ascent that reaches the overall maximum close to index 158.  Thereafter it drifts downward again, flattening into an extensive, lightly noisy negative terrace.  (Best overall fit is class 4; class 7 is a distant alternative.)

signal 3  
After a modest positive opening that soon sinks below zero, the signal rockets upward in a single steep ramp to its tallest peak around index 63.  It then slopes down across the zero line, levels briefly, and pushes up once more into a broader but much lower swell centred near index 151, before decaying into a wide, gently undulating negative shelf.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Starting just under the baseline, the trace races upward almost immediately, topping out in its dominant summit near index 14.  It then slides steadily downward toward zero, ripples through a modest bump centred around index 42, dips faintly sub-zero, and lifts into an even smaller swell at roughly index 67.  From there it drifts through weakening oscillations and comes to rest on a broad, gently undulating negative shelf.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
A brief opening uptick is followed by a gentle descent that bottoms in the mid-thirties.  Out of that shallow basin the curve rushes skyward to an initial peak close to index 70, falls back through the axis into a wide, rather deep negative plateau, then mounts a second and highest crest near index 157.  After that late summit it eases downward again, crossing the axis once more and flattening into a long, low-level negative table marked only by small ripples.  
best-matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
The series begins with weak, near-zero wiggles, then accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies around index 63.  It plunges back below the axis, rises into a broader but distinctly lower hill peaking near index 158, and finally subsides into a long, almost constant negative terrace with slight residual noise.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
From a slightly sub-zero launch the trace charges upward in one continuous sweep, reaching its unrivalled summit near index 14. It then slides back across the mid-line into a shallow dip, climbs again to a clearly smaller bump around index 42, shows only a modest later swell in the mid-sixties, and thereafter weakens through ever-diminishing ripples until it settles on a long, gently descending negative plain with little more than low-level noise.  
→ best fit: class_2  

signal 2  
The curve opens with a brief positive blip, sinks into a fairly long negative trough that bottoms out in the mid-teens, then powers up to a first major peak close to index 70. After falling away into a deep and rather flat sub-zero plateau it gathers strength once more, soaring to its overall maximum near index 132. From that second and higher crest it eases downward again, fading through small undulations into an extended, quietly declining negative shelf.  
→ best fit: class_4  

signal 3  
Beginning in mild negatives and dipping a shade further, the series suddenly accelerates into a steep climb that tops out at its dominant summit around index 63. It glides back towards zero, slips into weak negatives, then arches into a broader but noticeably lower hill centred roughly on index 120, before descending smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative table marked only by light residual oscillations. (Also bears some resemblance to class 3, but the timing and relative heights suit class 8 more closely.)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens with a brief, almost negligible dip below zero, then bursts into a rapid, high-speed climb that tops out at its dominant peak near index 14.  From that summit it drifts downward in a long, irregular glide that falls back toward the zero line, touches it and even slips very slightly negative around the low-thirties, and then wavers close to the axis.  A first modest after-peak (≈1.6) rises at index 42, is followed by a shallow lull, and a second, only slightly larger ridge (≈2.1) appears around index 67.  Beyond the mid-seventies the curve loses altitude for good, crosses firmly into negative terrain and settles into an extended, fairly flat negative shelf.  Apart from light ripples and one or two deeper nicks (for example the −0.75 dip in the 250s) nothing of consequence happens for the remainder of the record.  
Best fitting class: class_11 (the main crest lies in the mid-teens, several smaller crests follow, the trace finally crosses zero in the seventies and decays into a broad low-noise negative plateau).

Signal 2  
The trace begins with a modest positive bump but almost immediately slips below zero and stays there, wandering in a shallow, floor-hugging trough through roughly the first sixty points.  A strong up-slope then drives it to a sizeable peak near index 71.  This is followed by a smooth descent that carries the curve back into negative territory.  After a protracted flat-negative interval it rallies again, climbing even higher to a second summit—now the overall maximum—around index 160.  Thereafter the signal slides steadily downward and expires in a wide, gently undulating negative plain with no further significant structure.  
Best fitting class: (no adequate match).  None of the reference patterns features a first tall peak near the 70s followed by an even taller late-stage peak around 160; the closest templates either put the dominant summit early with a clearly smaller late bump, or place only one major peak.

Signal 3  
Starting in mild negatives, the curve hesitates briefly and then drives into a steep ascent that reaches its commanding maximum close to index 63.  From that mountain top it plunges back through zero into a distinct negative valley in the mid-seventies, then turns upward again into a broader, lower hill whose crest sits near index 151.  After this second rise the series declines once more, flattening out into a long, almost table-top negative shelf that is broken only by small-amplitude ripples.  
Best fitting class: class_3 (strong first peak, deep cross-zero drop, broader but lower second hump, long quasi-constant negative tail).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens a touch below zero, then races upward in a single, very steep climb to its highest peak around index 14.  From there it pours downhill, dipping back to the vicinity of the baseline, pauses in a mid-level hollow, lifts into a clearly smaller secondary hill centred near index 42, and finally subsides through a string of ever-weaker ripples into a long, gently declining negative shelf.  
Best match: class_2  

signal 2  
A small positive flicker at the start soon gives way to a prolonged shallow slide that bottoms out in the mid-thirties.  The curve then sweeps up to a first sizeable crest near index 69, drops sharply into its deepest, extended negative plateau, and later mounts a still higher summit close to index 161.  After that second and dominant peak it ebbs away, settling into a broad, lightly noisy negative table.  
Best match: class_4  

signal 3  
After a brief flick above the zero line the trace drifts in weak negatives, then accelerates into a steep ascent whose apex sits near index 63.  It falls back through zero into a wide, almost flat negative plain, apart from a noticeably lower second swell centred roughly at index 148, and then fades into a long, low-lying band with only minor undulations.  
Best match: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Starting a shade below the zero line, the curve vaults almost straight up to its dominant crest at about index 14, then drops into a moderate dip that barely brushes the negative side.  It rebounds to a noticeably smaller ridge near index 42, raises one last, still weaker hill around index 62, and thereafter drifts away through progressively softer ripples into a long, gently sloping negative plateau whose only activity is low-level noise.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
A short positive blip is followed by a mild slide that bottoms in the low negatives during the mid-thirties.  From there the trace climbs to a first substantial but not ultimate peak close to index 70, slips back into a broad, almost level negative shelf, then mounts a second and highest summit near index 158.  After that crest it tapers off gradually, ending in a wide, lightly fluctuating negative band.  
Best-matching class: class_4 (alt. class_1)  

Signal 3  
The series opens virtually at zero, dips into a fairly long shallow negative trough, and then rockets upward to its principal summit around index 63.  It glides downward into a broad, nearly flat negative table, shows only a modest secondary bump near index 159, and finally settles into an extended, gently undulating negative plain.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens with a tiny dip below zero, then hurtles upward in a single, very steep climb that tops out at its dominant summit close to index 14. From there it slides down in a long descent that crosses the axis, touches a mild negative hollow, lifts to a small bump near index 41, arches once more into a somewhat larger but still secondary hill centred around index 69, and at last ebbs away into an extended, gently declining negative table broken only by low-amplitude ripples.  
Best matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
A short positive flicker is followed by a gentle early slide that reaches its minimum in the low twenties. The trace then sweeps upward to an initial crest near index 66, falls back into a wide, rather flat sub-zero plain, after which it climbs again—more slowly but for longer—to attain its overall maximum at about index 146. Thereafter it recedes steadily, settling into a prolonged, lightly noisy negative shelf.  
Best matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
Beginning in weak negatives, the series races up a very steep face to its highest pinnacle at roughly index 63, plunges back through zero, rises once more into a broader yet distinctly lower hill peaking near index 125, and finally decays into a long, almost level negative plateau with only minor undulations.  
Best matching class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens with a small dip just below zero and immediately launches into a very steep rise that reaches its overall summit near index 14. From there the line glides downward through steadily weakening positives, brushing zero and slipping marginally negative. A modest rebound forms a first secondary hill around index 42, and a slightly higher but still clearly subordinate swell crests near index 67. Beyond that point the oscillations grow ever smaller and the series drifts into a long, almost level sub-zero terrace with only faint noise.  
Best match: class_2

Signal 2  
After a fleeting positive bump the trace slides into a broad, shallow negative basin that lasts for several dozen points. It then climbs to a clear but not yet dominant peak close to index 71, falls back to a deep negative table, and surges again—this time higher than before—to its global maximum around index 158. Once past that crest the curve slopes away and flattens into an extended, lightly rippled negative shelf. (The general two-peak pattern fits class 4 best; class 1 is a looser alternative.)  
Best match: class_4  (alternative: class_1)

Signal 3  
The curve begins in gentle negatives, then accelerates sharply into a high mountain whose apex lies near index 63. It dives back below zero, lingers in a broad sub-zero trough, and rises again into a wider but distinctly lower hill topping out near index 150. Thereafter it subsides smoothly into a long, almost constant negative plateau dotted with minor undulations. (Closely matches class 3; class 8 is a secondary possibility.)  
Best match: class_3  (alternative: class_8)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace dips just below zero at the outset, then shoots almost straight up to its dominant crest at about index 14.  From there it slides steadily downward, skimming the zero line until it briefly turns negative in the mid-thirties.  A modest rebound lifts it to a small secondary rise near index 42, after which it meanders close to zero, gathers itself once more and forms a broader but still clearly lower swell peaking around index 67.  Beyond that point the curve crosses decisively into the negatives and, apart from tiny ripples, stretches out as a long, gradually sagging sub-zero shelf.  
Best matching class: class_2 (a fairly close match; class_11 would be the distant alternative).

Signal 2  
The series opens with a short positive blip, but almost immediately sinks into an extended, rather flat negative basin that lasts for more than sixty indices.  It then surges upward in a strong climb to a high peak near index 72, tumbles back through zero, and briefly touches a shallow trough.  A second, even taller ascent follows, culminating in a new overall maximum close to index 145.  From that high point the curve declines again, eventually settling into another protracted, gently falling negative terrace.  Because the principal features consist of two well-separated major summits with the latter one higher than the first—and because none of the reference patterns display that specific ordering—this signal does not fit any of the given classes.

Signal 3  
Beginning as an almost level, mildly negative plain, the signal suddenly vaults sky-ward, reaching its dominant summit around index 62.  It then flows downward, crosses zero in the low seventies, forms a shallow negative trough, and climbs once more to a mid-sized second hill centred near index 115.  Thereafter it eases gradually downward into a long, virtually flat negative band mottled only by very small undulations.  
Best matching class: class_7.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Opening just below zero, the trace shoots almost immediately into a brisk climb that reaches its principal summit around index 14.  From there it slides down through a gentle mid-level slope, dips to the vicinity of the baseline, then rebounds to a noticeably smaller hump near index 42 and, after only a brief pause, lifts once more to a still lower rise peaking close to index 67.  Having spent its remaining strength, the curve drifts downward, crosses the axis and stretches out into a long, almost level negative plain whose only features are low-amplitude ripples.  
Best matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
The series starts a touch above zero, slips promptly into a shallow, fairly extended negative basin, and then launches a steep ascent that crests near index 72.  It slides back through a mild trough, rallies into a second crest—comparable but very slightly higher—centred close to index 161, and finally eases away into a broad, slowly deepening negative terrace marked by small, monotonous undulations.  
Best matching class: class_1  (class 5 would be a distant alternative because of the twin peaks, but the timing of the crests aligns much better with class 1.)

Signal 3  
After a brief flicker into weak positives the curve sags below zero, then gathers speed in a single, steep ramp that towers to its dominant summit at about index 63.  A smooth decline carries it back through the axis and into negative ground, where it rolls gently for a while before swelling into a distinctly lower, rounded secondary hill centred near index 147.  Thereafter it subsides steadily into an extensive, near-flat negative shelf with only faint noise.  
Best matching class: class_5

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Beginning just under zero, the curve marches upward through a sequence of ever-higher bumps until it bursts into its principal summit near index 14.  From that crest it slides steadily downward, hovers around the zero line, then flicks a small pulse at about index 42.  After a brief sub-zero dip it rises once more to a noticeably smaller second hill that tops out close to index 67, whereupon it drifts gently below zero and settles into a long, slowly deepening negative shelf enlivened only by very low-amplitude ripples.

signal 2  
A tiny early positive blip gives way to a shallow, extended negative basin whose floor lies in the mid-thirties.  The trace then springs upward in a long drive that reaches an initial peak near index 69, rolls downward through mild positives and crosses back into negative territory, stays subdued for a while, and finally launches a second, steeper ascent that crowns at its overall maximum around index 157.  From that highest crest it glides downward once more, fading through zero into a broad, gently sloping negative plateau dotted with minor noise.

signal 3  
Opening with weak, slightly negative undulations, the series accelerates into a steep mountain whose sharp apex stands near index 63.  It then plunges back through zero, gathers into a wider yet clearly lower hill peaking around index 148, and thereafter decays into an extended, almost flat negative table broken only by faint oscillations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1 – description  
It opens a hair below zero, then vaults straight into a rapid, almost ballistic rise that culminates in its dominant summit around index 14.  From there it slides steadily downward, crossing the axis in the low thirties, wanders through a shallow, low-positive hollow and a brief sub-zero dip, then throws up a noticeably smaller ridge peaking near index 42.  After another short lull it mounts one last intermediate hill whose crest sits close to index 67, still well lower than the first.  Beyond the early seventies the trace drifts below zero and, apart from small, ever-weaker ripples, relaxes into a long, gently declining negative reach.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2 – description  
The curve starts with a modest positive blip, slips quickly into negative ground and bottoms out in the mid-thirties.  It then charges upward to an initial peak at about index 71, falls back into a broad, fairly deep negative terrace that stretches through the nineties and early hundreds, and later gathers strength for a second, steeper ascent that reaches the overall maximum near index 162.  After that high point it eases downward again, crossing zero in the late 160s and settling into an extended, faintly noisy negative platform that deepens only very slowly toward the end.  
best-matching class: class_4  (class_5 would be a distant secondary candidate)  

signal 3 – description  
Beginning scarcely above the axis, it slips into a lengthy shallow negative basin, then rockets sky-ward to its principal summit around index 63.  Having crested, it glides back down through zero into a wide, almost level negative shelf.  Apart from one modest secondary bump centred near index 148, the remainder is little more than low-amplitude quiver on an otherwise steady, slightly descending negative floor.  
best-matching class: class_1

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens with a brief flicker above the zero line, dips a touch below, and then shoots almost straight up to its dominant summit at about index 14.  From that crest it glides downward through a middling positive slope, crosses the axis and hovers near zero, shows a clearly smaller secondary swell centred close to index 41, and thereafter slackens into an extended, gently declining negative stretch broken only by very low-amplitude ripples.  
Best–matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
A mild positive start soon gives way to a shallow slide that bottoms out in the high teens.  The trace then heaves upward to a pronounced first peak near index 70, slips back across zero into a broad, fairly deep negative terrace, and, after lingering there for a while, mounts a still steeper climb to its overall highest crest around index 142.  From that second, taller summit it eases steadily downward, finishing in a long, quietly undulating negative band.  
Best–matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
The curve begins in weak negatives, hesitates with a tiny early uptick, and then accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 63.  It plunges back through zero, steadies for a moment in shallow negatives, rises once more into a broader but clearly lower hill peaking roughly at index 110, and finally decays into a lengthy, almost flat negative shelf punctuated only by slight low-level noise.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens fractionally below zero, bursts upward in a single, very steep climb to its chief summit at about index 14, slides back down through positive values into a shallow, gently wavy negative dip, bounces to a lesser hill near index 42 and to an even milder bump around index 66, after which it trails away through ever-weaker ripples into a long, slowly declining negative stretch.

Best-matching class: class_2


signal 2  
A brief, modest decline carries the series down to its first floor in the mid-thirties; from there it surges to an early crest close to index 69, drops all the way into a broad negative plateau, then gathers strength for a second and higher ascent that reaches the overall maximum near index 156. Having crowned out, the trace eases downward once more and eventually rests on a wide, lightly noisy sub-zero shelf.

Best-matching class: class_4


signal 3  
Starting in light negatives and dipping slightly farther, the curve rockets into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 63, dives back through zero into a modest negative basin, rises again into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 125, and finally drifts downward into a deep, almost flat negative terrace marked only by faint oscillations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace begins with a tiny dip below zero and almost immediately swings into a brisk, slightly choppy climb that culminates in its dominant summit at about index 14.  It then slides back toward the baseline, rises again to a modest after-crest near index 41, and mounts a somewhat higher rebound around index 65.  From the low seventies it sinks through zero for the last time and eases into a long, deep, almost motionless negative plateau, disturbed only by low-amplitude jitter.  
Best-matching class: class_11 – main peak very early (≈16), a few dwindling crests that end with the final zero-crossing in the seventies, then an extended quiet negative floor.

Signal 2  
The series opens with a brief positive flick, descends into a wide, lightly undulating negative basin whose floor lies near index 37, and then rockets upward in a sustained climb to a high crest around index 69.  It rolls back down through zero into another broad sub-zero stretch, rallies once more to a second—but now very slightly higher—peak close to index 157, and finally subsides into a steadily deepening, quietly rippling negative shelf.  
Best-matching class: (no convincing match).  None of the reference patterns show a late crest that exceeds the first major one; consequently this signal does not fit any given class well.

Signal 3  
A modest positive flicker is followed by a short dip into weak negatives, after which the curve accelerates sharply sky-ward to its tallest summit near index 64.  It then glides downward, crosses zero, and spends a while in shallow negatives before rising again into a broader but distinctly lower swell centred near index 145.  Thereafter it ebbs smoothly into a long, almost flat negative plain with only minor tremors.  
Best-matching class: class_5 – modest positive start, dominant peak at ≈64, one smaller secondary swell near ≈139, finishing in an extended negative plateau.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Opening just below the axis, the trace surges almost immediately into a steep climb that towers at its principal summit near index 14.  From there it glides downward through still-positive terrain, touches zero in the low thirties, and even slips a little into the red before rebounding to a modest hill around index 42.  A second, slightly larger but still clearly sub-dominant crest appears near index 67, after which the curve slides gradually below zero and stretches out into a long, gently wavering negative flat that persists to the end.  
Best matching prototype: class_2  

Signal 2  
A brief initial uptick is followed by a mild early slump that bottoms around index 37.  The series then rockets upward to an “first” crest close to index 69, falls back through zero into an extended negative terrace, and later mounts a still-higher, overall maximum in the vicinity of index 158.  Finally it drifts away into a broad, slowly deepening negative shelf whose surface is broken only by low-amplitude noise.  
Best matching prototype: class_4  

Signal 3  
The curve begins with small, mixed-sign undulations, dips a little further below zero, and then accelerates into a single, steep ramp that reaches its dominant peak at about index 63.  It slips back through the axis into a shallow negative basin, climbs once more into a broader but distinctly lower hill peaking near index 132, and thereafter decays smoothly into a wide, almost level negative plain marked only by faint ripples.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens a hair below zero, then fires almost straight up to a single dominant summit located near index 14.  From that crest it glides steadily downward, crossing the zero line and dipping very slightly negative.  After a short spell of small-amplitude wobbling a modest bump shows up around index 42 and a somewhat broader but still clearly lower hill tops out near index 64.  Beyond that point the trace drifts ever more gently into a wide, nearly level negative plain that persists to the end with only faint noise.  
Best fitting pattern: class_2 (main crest very early, lesser hill in the forties, prolonged negative tail).

Signal 2  
A brief positive blip at the very beginning is followed by a long, shallow descent that establishes a gently undulating negative basin lasting into the mid-sixties.  The curve then vaults upward in a single swift climb to a tall crest at about index 71.  It rolls down again through zero into another negative shelf, only to rally once more into a second peak—slightly higher than the first—centred roughly on index 160.  After this second rise the series eases back down and settles into a deep, slowly declining negative terrace peppered with low-level fluctuations.  
No reference class shows this “double-mountain, second-one-higher” layout at the indicated positions, so the signal does not convincingly match any of the eleven patterns.

Signal 3  
Starting with a tiny positive wiggle that soon slips below zero, the signal surges into a steep, fast-rising mountain whose apex lies close to index 63.  It then slides back down across the zero line, continuing into negative territory before lifting again into a broader but much smaller swell that peaks near index 146.  From there it fades smoothly into an expansive, almost flat negative shelf, disturbed only by minor, low-amplitude ripples.  
Best fitting pattern: class_5 (tallest summit in the low-sixties, smaller secondary swell in the 140s, final negative plain).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Beginning a touch below zero, the trace catapults into a rapid, almost straight-line ascent that reaches its dominant summit near index 14.  From there it glides downward through a long, shallow decline that dips just under the baseline, then flicks up into a modest knoll around index 42 and a slightly larger rebound near index 67.  After that it weakens steadily, passing through zero once more and flattening into an extended, gently drifting negative plain whose only life is an occasional low-amplitude ripple.  
Best matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
A short positive blip is followed by a mild slide that bottoms out in the mid-thirties, ushering in a broad, low-lying negative basin.  The curve then explodes upward to an initial peak close to index 71, drops back into a deep, almost level negative shelf, and subsequently climbs even higher to its overall summit around index 160.  Thereafter it eases downward and settles on a wide, lightly noisy negative terrace that persists to the end.  
Best matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
Opening in weak negatives, the series surges into a steep mountain whose apex stands near index 63.  It plunges through zero, cruises in negative territory for a while, then arches into a broader yet noticeably lower hill peaking around index 159.  Finally it decays into a long, virtually flat negative shelf broken only by small undulations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Starting with a tiny dip just below zero, the curve vaults almost straight up to its commanding summit at about index 14.  From there it coasts downward through a mid-level hollow, kicks up into a smaller bump near index 42 and an even slighter swell around index 67, then slides gently across the zero line and, apart from mild surface ripples, stretches out into a long, slowly deepening negative plateau.  
→ best matches : class_2  

signal 2  
A brief positive blip is followed by a smooth descent into a broad, shallow negative trough whose floor lies in the mid-thirties.  The signal then embarks on a long, steady climb that produces an initial peak near index 71, drops back into a deep sub-zero shelf, surges again to reach its highest crest around index 150, and finally drains away through weakening undulations into an extended, gently sloping negative plain.  
→ best matches : class_4  (class_1 is a distant second choice)  

signal 3  
The trace opens with a modest positive twitch, sags a little, and then races upward in a steep ramp that reaches its overall maximum close to index 63.  It rolls down across zero in the low seventies, levels into a wide, almost flat negative band, rises once more into a noticeably lower secondary hill centred near index 147, and ultimately subsides into a deep, near-stationary negative shelf dotted with tiny fluctuations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Beginning a touch below zero, the trace vaults almost immediately into a steep, accelerating climb that culminates in its dominant summit near index 14.  From there it slides briskly downward, dipping a hair beneath the axis, then rebounds to a modest bump around index 42 and rises once more to a slightly larger but still secondary crest close to index 66.  After that it drains away through zero and settles into a broad, gently sloping negative stretch that persists to the end with only faint, low-amplitude wrinkles.  
→ best fits class_2

signal 2  
A brief positive flicker is followed by a shallow descent that bottoms in the upper-teen indices.  The curve then surges to an initial peak near index 69, falls back into a wide, noticeably negative terrace, and launches again—this time higher—toward its overall summit at roughly index 132.  From that high point it glides downward through a train of ever-weaker ripples, finally resting on a long, almost level negative shelf with sparse minor noise.  
→ best fits class_4

signal 3  
Opening on an almost level mild-negative ledge, the series explodes upward into a steep mountain whose apex sits near index 63.  It rolls down past zero into a modest trough, climbs anew into a broad but lower hill centred around index 109, and then subsides gradually into a steady, lightly noisy negative table that carries through to the finish.

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
A fraction below zero at the outset, the trace surges almost at once into a steep climb that reaches its absolute summit near index 14.  From there it glides downward, throwing up two noticeably smaller crests around indices 42 and 67, then slips through the baseline in the low-seventies.  Beyond that crossing it enters a long, slow decline that settles into a deep, virtually motionless negative plateau broken only by very low-amplitude noise to the end.  
Best-matching class: class_11

signal 2  
The series opens with a modest positive flicker but soon drifts downward, touching its deepest dip in the mid-thirties.  It then rockets up to a first, mid-sized peak close to index 69 before dropping back into a broad negative stretch.  A renewed, stronger ascent follows, carrying the curve to its overall maximum near index 158.  After that high point it descends again and stretches out into a long, gently undulating negative shelf that persists to the finish.  
Best-matching class: class_4

signal 3  
Starting just above the baseline, the curve sinks into a protracted, shallow negative basin, then blasts upward in a sharp rise that crowns at its dominant pinnacle around index 63.  It slides back below zero into a fairly flat negative band, climbs once more into a broader yet clearly lower secondary hump peaking in the mid-140s, and finally ebbs into an extended, almost unchanging negative table adorned with only minor ripples.

signal 1  
Description: The curve starts a hair below zero, then bursts upward in a fast, almost straight climb that culminates in its highest summit near index 15. From that peak it glides downward toward the baseline, momentarily dipping slightly negative before rebounding into a small hump at about index 42 and a broader, still lower swell centred near index 70. Beyond this point the oscillations weaken progressively and the trace settles into a long, nearly flat negative plateau broken only by low-amplitude noise.  
Best matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
Description: A brief positive blip opens the record, but it soon drifts into a low, gently undulating negative stretch. Out of that hollow the series rises to a substantial early crest a little past index 70, drops back through zero into a deep negative table, and then launches a longer, steeper ascent that attains the overall maximum close to index 150. Thereafter the signal slopes downward again, crossing below zero and fading into a broad, lightly rippled negative shelf.  
Best matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
Description: Beginning in weak negatives the signal ambles almost flat for a short while, then accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies around index 63. It plunges back through zero, climbs once more into a broader but lower hill peaking near index 130, and finally decays into an extended, nearly constant negative terrace mottled with small-scale noise.  
Best matching class: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace begins a touch below zero, then launches almost immediately into a brisk, near-exponential climb that crests in its dominant summit around index 14.  From there it slides downhill through a string of modest positives, dips under the axis, lifts again into a clearly smaller hill centred near index 42, slips back to negative, and produces one still-weaker bump at roughly index 67.  After that the oscillations shrink rapidly and the signal settles into a long, slowly easing, low-level negative stretch with only minor flicker.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
A brief positive flick at the very start gives way to a steady shallow descent that widens into a fairly flat negative floor extending to the mid-sixties.  The curve then rockets upward in a sweeping ramp to a first, sizeable peak close to index 69, rolls down through zero, and spends a short interval in sub-zero calm.  From that lull it surges once more, this time to a still higher, overall maximum near index 158.  Thereafter the series drifts downward, breaking into a patchwork of small ripples before settling on an extensive, gently deepening negative terrace.  
Best-matching class: class_4  (class_9 would be the next-closest alternative)

signal 3  
Opening in light negatives, the signal accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex sits near index 63.  It plunges back through zero, pauses in a shallow dip, and then rolls into a broader but substantially lower hill peaking around index 146.  Finally the curve decays smoothly into a long, almost flat negative shelf that shows only faint, low-amplitude undulations.  
Best-matching class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It starts just above zero, sinks into a fairly long shallow negative basin, then rockets upward to its dominant summit around index 76, slides back down into a broad, almost flat negative plateau and, apart from a small secondary bump near index 164, finishes with only gentle low-level fluctuations.
class_2: Beginning slightly below zero, it climbs sharply to its main crest near index 15, drops into a mid-level dip, rebounds to a smaller hill at about index 43, and then fades through progressively weaker ripples into an extended, gently declining negative stretch.
class_3: The curve opens in weak negatives, accelerates into a steep mountain whose apex lies near index 40, plunges back through zero, rises into a broader but lower hill peaking around index 94, and finally decays into a long, nearly constant negative shelf with minor undulations.
class_4: After a mild early slide that bottoms out near index 17, it surges to an initial peak at index 36, retreats all the way to a deep negative plateau, climbs again to its highest crest close to index 89, and then eases downward into a sustained low-lying, lightly fluctuating negative band.
class_5: A modest positive start drifts below zero, followed by a single steep ramp to the tallest summit near index 64; the trace then slopes down through positive into negative territory, shows a secondary but much smaller swell centred on index 139, and finally settles on a broad, gently varying negative plain.
class_6: Opening with a shallow decline, the signal swings into an explosive rise that tops out near index 34, descends through positive values to a brief sub-zero dip, arches into a noticeably smaller crest around index 83, and thereafter glides into an ever-flattening negative terrace peppered with small ripples.
class_7: It begins as an almost level mild-negative plateau, leaps upward to a prominent maximum at about index 58, rolls downward past zero into a modest trough, rises again to a mid-sized hill near index 110, and then gradually subsides into a steady, lightly noisy negative table.
class_8: Starting in moderate negatives and dipping slightly further, the trace sweeps upward into its dominant peak around index 43, glides downward toward zero, mounts a lower second peak near index 120, and finally descends smoothly into a deep, almost constant negative shelf with faint oscillations.
class_9: Launching from a sizeable positive level, it cascades downward through zero into a broad negative basin, surges in a long climb to its highest summit close to index 75, and thereafter tapers away through a patchwork of smaller ripples into an extended, slowly deepening negative plateau.
class_10: After a short flat negative opening it rises steadily to a modest crest near index 19, slips back below zero, accelerates into a sharp ascent that reaches the overall maximum around index 52, slopes downward across zero again, shows a minor bump roughly at index 109, and ends in a prolonged, gently drifting negative trench.
class_11: Beginning with an undulating positive stretch that builds to its main peak near index 16, the series meanders downward through smaller crests, crosses zero in the seventies, and continues into a long descent that settles into a deep, almost stationary negative plateau with only slight low-amplitude noise.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It begins with a tiny sub-zero dip, swings almost immediately into a brisk climb that crests in its undisputed maximum near index 14, then drifts downward through a long string of gently shrinking ridges.  A first lesser hump appears around index 42 and a slightly broader but still lower rise shows up near index 67.  After sliding back through zero in the low seventies the trace flattens into a deep, almost motionless negative shelf whose only activity is low-amplitude noise up to the end.  
best matching class: class_11  

signal 2  
A brief positive blip at the very start gives way to a prolonged shallow descent that bottoms in the mid-thirties.  From there the curve rockets upward to a strong, though not final, crest at about index 71, drops back across zero into a wide flat negative terrace, and then mounts a second, still steeper surge that tops out in the overall summit close to index 160.  The series finally slips once more into an extensive, lightly rippled sub-zero plain.  
best matching class: class_4 (the only template that features a smaller first peak followed by the tallest second peak after an extended negative spell)  

signal 3  
After a modest positive flicker the trace eases below zero, pauses, and then launches a single sharp ramp that drives it to its highest summit around index 63.  It then glides downward through positive territory, crosses the axis in the low seventies and settles into negatives, where a noticeably smaller second swell rises near index 151.  The curve finally subsides into a broad, gently undulating negative plateau that lasts to the finish.  
best matching class: class_5
