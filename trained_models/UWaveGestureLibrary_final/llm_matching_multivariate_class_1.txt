 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Commencing on a mild negative shelf, the trace lifts to a small crest at index 2, dips a little lower at 16, and then rockets to an early pronounced summit at 21.  From that height it plunges into its widest and deepest hollow, centred near index 40, and settles into a remarkably flat negative table that stretches into the low 100s.  A steady climb then carries the curve to a mid-range ridge peaking about index 137, after which it slides into another broad hollow spanning roughly 170-190.  At that point the record breaks upward once more, mounting its overall maximum close to index 244 before fading in a gentle undulating fall.  
best fit: class_8  

signal 2  
After a brief mildly positive opening ledge capped near index 19, the series falls through zero and flattens into a long, nearly level negative terrace that lasts from the low-30s to a little past index 110.  A vigorous up-sweep raises it to a broad, gently rounded roof topping around index 145, followed by a sharp descent that bottoms just before index 180.  A smaller rebound reaches a secondary crest near 210, whereupon the signal drifts downward in diminishing waves.  
best fit: class_4  

signal 3  
The record begins with faint negative flickers, sags a bit farther to a local minimum at index 28, then climbs smoothly through the axis to form its first positive platform, which tops out near index 69.  It promptly collapses into a long, very flat trench occupying most of the 70s and 80s, then ascends again to twin crests at indices 96 and 151 (the latter higher).  After easing back toward zero it dives to a deep pocket centred on about index 186, and finally ends with a hesitant, ripple-studded recovery.  
best fit: class_3  

signal 4  
Opening just below zero, the curve rises through paired early peaks at indices 9 and 11 (the second the taller), then tumbles to its deepest valley around index 51.  A recovery lifts it into a long, low-amplitude shelf that straddles the axis between roughly indices 60 and 90.  It then pushes higher into a broad, rounded crest that records the overall maximum near index 103 and lingers into the low-110s.  Thereafter the trace slides into an extended negative table whose floor lies in the 150-170 region, before staging a gradual comeback that crests modestly near index 230 and finally ebbs away.

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The record starts a little below the axis, climbs quickly through a small bump in the low single-digits and then surges to a first and tallest crest about index 22. From there it slides, first gently and then abruptly, into its deepest valley at index 40. A long, almost level negative table follows through the 40s, 50s and well into the 70s. The trace then rises in a steady stair-step to a broad positive shelf that tops out between indices 115-130, drops away again into a second extended hollow centred in the mid-160s, and finally mounts a vigorous late-stage climb that produces a third major peak close to index 210 before ebbing away in a mild decline.  
Best matching class: class_8 (also shares a few features with class_5, but the early-crest / late-crest pair and the intervening double hollow match class 8 much more closely).

Signal 2  
A brief flat positive ledge (indices 0-19) is followed by a plunge to the global minimum at index 27. Instead of rebounding strongly, the curve settles into an extraordinarily long, almost perfectly flat negative terrace that lasts from the low-30s to roughly index 135. It then shoots upward to a series of medium-high crests beginning near index 155, oscillates downward again into another ragged negative stretch through the 180s–210s, and finally breaks upward once more to a late overall maximum around index 227 before drifting back toward the axis and finishing just below zero. The sequence of events is similar in outline to class 2 (positive shelf → deepest dip at ~29 → big late maximum → fade), though the middle section is much more stationary than the prototype.  
Best matching class: class_2 (closest of the available patterns, though the fit is imperfect).

Signal 3  
Opening on a mild negative shelf, the trace slips a little further to its first real trough at index 28, then climbs decisively through zero to its first positive plateau and earliest crest near index 39. After a short easing the series swings upward again, levelling into a second positive table that peaks between indices 63-70. A sharp collapse follows, producing a broad, almost level trench from the mid-70s well into the 90s. The curve recovers to twin crests at about indices 103 and 175 (the latter higher), eases toward the axis, dives into another deep pocket centred in the 190s, and ends with a hesitant, ripple-filled recovery.  
Best matching class: class_3.

Signal 4  
The run begins on a moderate negative shelf, then drives smartly upward to an early high at index 11–14. From there it decays almost monotonically, crossing zero in the mid-40s and sliding into a long level negative terrace whose floor sits roughly in the 70s-90s. A broad climb then sets in, forming a flat-topped ridge that culminates near index 110. This gives way to a steep descent that bottoms around index 170, after which the trace rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 200 and finally subsides in a mild decline.  
Best matching class: class_4.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace opens on a shallow negative shelf, pricks slightly lower at about index 16, then climbs briskly to an early crest near index 21 (≈1.5) and a couple of smaller follow-up humps in the low 30s. From there it plunges to its deepest valley at index 40 (≈–1.8) and settles into a remarkably flat sub-zero terrace that lasts from the high 40s into the low 70s. A steady ascent carries the curve to a secondary summit around index 115 (≈1.3), after which it slides once more into a broad negative table whose floor, close to –1.1, spans roughly indices 150–165. Beginning in the 180s the signal stages a long, smooth climb that reaches its overall maximum (≈1.8) near index 221, then fades in gentle positive ripples.  
Best fitting class: class_8 (the sequence of an early crest, mid-record deep basin, a later secondary hump and a still later dominant peak matches this template most closely).

Signal 2  
After a brief dip below zero the series sits on a low-amplitude positive shelf through about index 20, producing only a modest bump. It then dives sharply, hitting its deepest trough at index 27 (≈–1.4), and settles into an exceptionally flat ledge just under –0.9 that persists for nearly eighty indices. A sudden upswing carries the line back across the axis; it makes a middling crest in the low 130s, eases, and then surges to its global maximum (≈1.7) a little past index 190. From that high point it undulates downward in gradually diminishing swings, finishing close to the zero line.  
Best fit: class_2 (short positive opening, deepest dip in the high 20s, long flat negative stretch, rocket to a lone dominant peak, then wavering decline).  A weaker alternate would be class 6.

Signal 3  
The record begins with tiny positive jitter, tips gently negative and, through a staircase of ever deeper slips, reaches its absolute minimum (≈–2.1) at index 28. A vigorous, almost linear rise follows, cresting first at index 38 (≈1.9). The trace then subsides through zero and, after a brief pause, sinks into an extended almost-level trench that occupies the high-70s to about index 90. Emerging from that trench it climbs to paired crests at indices 92 (≈1.3) and 150 (≈1.9), the latter higher. It eases back toward the axis, drops into a noticeable pocket in the 180s, and ends with a hesitant, rippled recovery.  
Best fitting class: class_3 (deep early pit, long flat negative segment, two later crests with the second higher, and a late dip before the finish).

Signal 4  
A slightly negative start is followed by a quick surge to twin early peaks centred on index 11 (the second higher at ≈1.6). Thereafter the line decays almost monotonically, crossing zero in the 30s and bottoming in a pronounced trough near index 57 (≈–1.4). A gentle climb then leads to a long, fairly flat positive shelf through the 80s, after which the signal swells into its broad, highest plateau that tops out around index 100 (≈2.0). From that high it slips into a steep descent and settles on an extended, very level negative table (≈–0.85) spanning roughly indices 130–170. Finally it rebounds to a modest late-stage crest close to index 205 before trailing off.  
Best fit: class_5 (paired early peaks, deepest valley in the low 60s, shelf straddling the axis, later broad top, long negative table in the 160s, and a smaller final crest).  A looser secondary match could be class 4.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The record begins just below the axis, pops up through a first modest crest at index 2, drops briefly, then drives higher to a taller peak at index 21 and a partner rise at index 35.  It then dives abruptly to its deepest trough at index 40 and settles into a long, almost level negative table that runs through roughly indices 50-80.  A steady climb carries it back above zero into a broad, low-relief positive shelf whose crown sits near index 128.  From there it falls again into a second extended hollow that bottoms in the mid-170s, before mounting a long, late-stage recovery whose global maximum is reached close to index 245.  Thereafter the trace eases off in a gentle decline.  
Best‐matching class: class_5 (class_4 is a weaker alternative).

Signal 2  
After a short positive porch capped by several small humps (indices 1–19) the curve plunges to its absolute minimum at index 27.  Instead of rebounding sharply, it sinks into a very broad, almost featureless negative shelf that persists from the low-30s clear past index 110, dipping slightly further near index 57 and again near index 99.  A gradual climb finally lifts the trace above the axis and into a modest ridge that straddles indices 135-150.  Subsequent motion is unruly: it sags back below zero, swings up to a secondary crest around index 168, slips once more into the red, then surges late to another peak near index 230 before tapering toward zero.  None of the reference patterns displays this long early flat trench followed by several scattered, unequal rebounds.  
Best‐matching class: none of the eight classes fit convincingly.

Signal 3  
The series opens with a faint positive shelf, plunges to a sharp early minimum at index 28, then rockets to a tall peak at index 38.  It relaxes, swings negative and bottoms again near index 77, pushes up to a modest mid-range crest in the low-90s, dips still lower to its deepest pocket at index 115, and then mounts a brisk ascent that culminates in the global maximum at index 144.  A renewed decline takes it back into the red around index 175, but a fresh climb produces a late crest close to index 210 before the trace finally ebbs.  
Best‐matching class: class_7 (class_3 would be a distant alternative).

Signal 4  
Beginning on a shallow negative ledge, the trace climbs smartly to paired early highs at indices 11 and 14, the second only slightly higher.  A prolonged, gentle sag follows, pulling the curve through zero and down to its first major valley at index 52.  The signal then rises into a mild positive terrace spanning the high-60s, slips again, and launches into its overall summit at index 103.  From there it falls into a wide, nearly level negative plain that dominates indices 125-150, crawls out to a mid-sized hump near index 190, spirals down to its lowest basin at index 208, and closes with a measured rebound that tops out around index 237 before fading.  Although it shares fragments with several templates, its sequence and timing do not line up well with any single reference pattern.  
Best‐matching class: none of the eight classes fit satisfactorily.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace opens a little below zero, leaps into a shallow positive shelf that crests first at about index 2, eases down and dips more decisively to a brief local minimum around index 16, then sweeps sharply upward to a prominent early peak close to index 21. From there it rolls over and plunges into its broadest negative basin, whose flat floor (global minimum at index 41) stretches almost unbroken from the high-40s into the low-120s. A patient, stepped climb then carries the curve to a secondary summit near index 143. It slides again into a shorter, shallower hollow centred roughly on indices 170-180, and finally mounts its tallest peak in the low 230s before fading in a mildly noisy decline.  
Best overall match: class_4  (class_1 is a distant second choice).

Signal 2  
After a very short positive shelf that sports several modest crests by index 19, the series plunges to its deepest trough at index 27. It settles into an unusually long, almost level negative table that lasts for close to one hundred points. A belated rebound lifts the line to a middling peak near index 155, but this success is short-lived: the signal sags again, touching fresh negatives in the 190s, before an abrupt late-stage burst rockets to the overall maximum around index 230. Thereafter it drifts back toward the axis in diminishing oscillations.  
No existing reference pattern fits this sequence closely enough to justify a class assignment.

Signal 3  
Beginning on a mild, slightly negative ledge, the record slips a little further around index 22, then climbs steadily through the axis to its first strong crest near index 38. It plateaus for a moment before collapsing into a broad, almost level trench spanning roughly indices 75-90 (deepest point at 75). A renewed ascent produces paired positive peaks at indices 96 and 157—the latter the higher—followed by a gentle easing toward zero. The trace then drops into a deep pocket centred on about index 185, and ends with a hesitant recovery peppered with small ripples that never quite regain the earlier heights.  
Best overall match: class_3.

Signal 4  
Starting from a modest negative value, the curve vaults to an early cluster of highs between indices 10 and 14, the tallest at 11. A fairly steady decline takes it through zero in the mid-40s to a sharp negative trough near index 52. It rebounds into a long, low-amplitude positive shelf occupying roughly indices 65-90, accelerates into its global summit just beyond index 100, then slips into a steep descent which levels out as an extended negative terrace from about index 130 to the mid-170s (lowest near 174). A late-stage rally reaches a smaller peak around index 193 before the signal ebbs away.  
Best overall match: class_8  (class_4 is a lesser but possible alternative).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Opening marginally below the axis, the trace lifts in two quick steps to modest crests at indices 2 and 21 (the latter higher), then plunges to its deepest valley at index 40.  It stays there as an unusually long, almost level negative terrace that stretches through the mid-90s.  A steady climb follows, topping out on a middle-sized ridge that straddles roughly indices 130-140, after which the curve slides into another broad depression whose floor lies in the high-170s.  From that hollow it rallies once more, driving up to its highest peak near index 216, and finally winds down in a gently noisy drift toward zero.  
best-matching class: class_5  

signal 2  
The record starts with a short, flat positive shelf that includes several small crests below index 20.  It then dives abruptly to its first and deepest trough at index 27 and settles on an unusually long, almost constant negative ledge that lasts to well past index 110.  A slow, irregular ascent breaks the monotony, pushing to a mid-range summit near index 133, wobbling down again, and – very late – thrusting to a slightly higher second peak around index 205 before subsiding in low-amplitude ripples.  The overall sequence of events does not correspond closely to any of the eight reference patterns.  
best-matching class: (no convincing match)  

signal 3  
Beginning on a mild negative shelf, the signal dips a little further at index 22, then swings upward through the axis into a first broad positive table whose top lies between indices 60 and 70, capped by a crest near 38.  It collapses next into an extended, nearly flat trench spanning the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to secondary crests at about indices 96 and 157 (the latter higher), eases back, falls into a deep pocket centred near index 185, and ends with a hesitant recovery punctuated by minor ripples.  
best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The curve starts on a moderate positive ledge and climbs quickly to an early high at index 11-14, then decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s into a long, level negative terrace that persists through the 80s-90s.  Turning upward, it forms a broad, flat-topped ridge peaking between indices 105 and 115, slips into a steep descent that bottoms in the mid-170s, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest near index 215 before tapering away.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
Opening just a little below the axis, the trace leaps to a small hill at index 2, slips back, then dips a shade deeper to a local minimum near index 16.  From there it accelerates into its first conspicuous crest – still fairly early – at about index 21.  A head-long slide through zero sends the curve into its broadest and deepest negative basin, whose almost level floor spans roughly indices 40-90.  Emerging, it climbs in stages to a mid-range summit around index 120, wavers, and drops again into an extended hollow centred in the 160s.  At last the record mounts a powerful late-stage rally, reaching its global maximum close to index 225, and then fades in a gently undulating decline.  
Best matching class: class_8 (possible but weaker alternative: class_5)

Signal 2  
The curve begins on a fairly flat positive shelf, then dives sharply to its overall minimum at index 27.  What follows is an extraordinarily long, almost level negative table occupying roughly indices 30-120.  A steady climb then lifts the signal into a cluster of medium-height crests between about indices 140 and 180, after which it falls once more to a secondary trough near index 206.  A final late surge vaults the trace to a sharp ridge around index 220 before it drifts away with smaller, uneven swings.  This progression does not correspond closely to any of the eight reference patterns.  
Best matching class: none fits convincingly.

Signal 3  
The record opens on a short, low positive plateau, plunges to a deep first trough at index 28, and rebounds precipitously to an early tall peak at index 38.  It eases off, dips briefly negative again in the mid-50s, then rises to a secondary shelf that tops out near index 69.  A collapse ensues into a broad negative pocket whose floor lies around index 75, followed by a recovery to a moderate crest at index 96.  The trace sinks still deeper to a wider trough centred near index 110, then mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum at about index 157.  After sliding back below zero around index 185 it stages one more, smaller late-cycle climb peaking in the low 220s before subsiding.  
Best matching class: class_7

Signal 4  
Beginning slightly below zero, the signal vaults rapidly to an early major peak at index 11.  Thereafter it almost monotonically declines, crossing the axis in the low-40s and settling into a long, level negative terrace that persists through roughly indices 50-90.  Turning upward once more, it sweeps into a broad, high flat-top that culminates near index 104.  A sharp slide then carries it to its deepest point in the mid-170s, after which a modest rebound produces a secondary crest around index 188.  The trace then ebbs away in a series of diminishing ripples.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Opening a little below the axis, the trace nips up to a modest first crest at index 2, slips hard to its absolute minimum at index 16, then vaults sharply to an early and highest peak at index 21.  From there it wavers for a few points and then plunges into a broad, almost level negative table that stretches from roughly indices 40 to 90.  A long, stepped climb lifts the curve back through zero to a gently rounded secondary ridge centred in the mid-130s, after which it sags into a second extended hollow occupying the 170-190 band.  At last the series stages a forceful late-stage rally, attaining a third pronounced summit near index 240, and fades in a mild positive drift toward the end.  
Best matching class: class_5  

signal 2  
After a brief spell of small positive bumps through about index 19, the series dives to its deepest trough at index 27.  It then sticks to an extraordinarily flat negative shelf that lasts for nearly eighty samples.  A slow escape leads to a rounded mid-height crest around index 135, followed by another slip below the axis in the 160s.  Next the signal rockets upward to its global maximum near index 210, and thereafter undulates downward with diminishing swings, finishing a hair below zero.  
Best matching class: class_2 (the overall shape—with an early deepest dip, an intermediate crest, a higher later peak and a tapering tail—accords most closely with that pattern, though the time-axis is somewhat stretched)  

signal 3  
The record starts on a small positive shelf, plunges to a deep minimum at index 28, then shoots to a tall peak at index 38.  It relaxes for a while and swings negative again to a trough near index 110, dips still farther to the lowest point at index 117, and mounts a brisk ascent that culminates in the global maximum about index 157.  A renewed fall carries the trace back below zero around index 185, but a fresh climb produces another prominent crest close to index 223 before the signal subsides.  
Best matching class: class_7  

signal 4  
Beginning slightly below zero, the curve leaps to an early high at index 11, slides steadily downward, crossing the axis in the mid-40s and reaching a broad negative basin whose floor lies at index 52.  It then turns upward into a shallow positive shelf spanning roughly indices 65-90, after which a powerful surge delivers the global maximum at index 104.  From this height the series descends into a very long, nearly flat negative terrace (≈ −0.85) extending from the low-120s to the mid-170s.  A brief but sharp dip bottoms near index 177, followed by a smaller rebound crest around index 194.  The trace then slips once more into deeper negative ground (minimum near index 208) and ends with a hesitant recovery.  
Best matching class: class_8 (shares the sequence of an early peak, mid-record deep trough, intervening shelf, and a second later peak; indices are shifted but the broad pattern is closest)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
From a mild negative opening the waveform rises into a low positive shelf, then slips a little further to a local dip at index 16. It immediately arcs upward to score its first and tallest crest at index 21, after which it eases down, touches the axis at index 31 and plunges into a broad, almost level negative basin whose floor ( ≈ –1.8) lies between indices 40 and 90. A steady climb follows, carrying the trace to a secondary summit about index 131, then it slides again into another shallow hollow spanning roughly indices 171-178. Renewed ascent produces a third prominent peak near index 255 before the curve drifts away in a gently noisy decline.  
Best matching class: class_1  

Signal 2  
Beginning just below zero, the series leaps through two close early crests at indices 1 and 3 (the latter slightly higher), then drops abruptly to its deepest valley at index 27. It settles into a long, flat-bottomed negative terrace lasting from the low-30s to about index 120. Climbing out, it forms a moderate hump around index 140 and a broader, still modest, plateau that extends through the mid-150s. A fresh descent carries the trace into another lengthy negative table whose floor lies in the 160-190 range, after which a gradual comeback culminates in a late-stage maximum near index 225. Thereafter it ebbs toward the axis.  
Best matching class: class_5  

Signal 3  
The record starts on a gentle negative ledge and dips a little farther to a local minimum at index 22. It then rises steadily through the axis, topping out in a first positive table centred near index 38-39. After a brief pull-back it collapses into an extended, flat trench from the mid-70s well into the 90s. A renewed climb puts up consecutive crests at indices 97 and 149 (the latter the higher), followed by an easing toward zero. The trace next sinks into a deep pocket centred near index 185 and finishes with a hesitant ripple-marked recovery.  
Best matching class: class_3  

Signal 4  
Opening slightly below the axis, the curve surges to an early peak at index 11, then descends through zero and bottoms in a sharp trough around index 52. It climbs into a modest positive shelf spanning the low-70s, gathers strength and reaches its overall maximum at index 108, before sliding down again into an extended negative table (about –0.85) that stretches from roughly index 130 to the mid-170s. A choppy upswing produces medium-height crests in the vicinity of indices 195-200, but this is followed by the deepest depression of the record (≈ –1.63) near index 215. A final, smaller rise peaks close to index 260, after which the trace wanes.  
This sequence does not fit any of the given reference patterns closely enough to warrant a confident match.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening a touch below zero, the record climbs almost at once to a modest hill at index 2, then slips back beneath the axis to a first clear dip at 16.  It rebounds in a sharp rush to a taller early crest at 21, hesitates on a mild positive ledge, and rolls over a second lesser summit in the mid-30s.  From there it plunges head-long into its deepest and widest negative basin, bottoming near index 41 and dragging out as a flat floor that runs through the high-70s.  A long climb follows: the trace rises through zero, levels into a low-amplitude shelf, and reaches a secondary peak a little above one unit in the neighbourhood of 129, after which it eases downward again.  A fresh slide carries it into another extended hollow centred around indices 175-185.  Beginning about 210 the signal stages a determined comeback, mounting its global maximum in the mid-260s before fading in a gently undulating decline.  
Best overall match: class 5  

signal 2  
After a brief positive porch the curve shows a handful of small bumps, then drops abruptly through zero to its deepest trough at index 27.  What follows is a remarkably long, almost level negative terrace, hugging about –0.9 from the low-30s clear past the century mark.  Just after 130 the trace rockets upward, exploding straight into its overall maximum near index 140.  Thereafter it oscillates downward in successively smaller swings: a cluster of mid-range crests in the 150-170 zone, another spell of negatives in the 190s (reaching a local floor a little below –1½), and finally a late rebound that tops out around 220 before the record trickles away to finish a shade under zero.  
Best overall match: class 2  

signal 3  
The series starts quietly just above the axis, wavers, then slides into a first negative pocket that reaches a sharp minimum at index 28.  A brisk climb carries it clean through zero to a strong early crest at 38, after which it settles onto a gentle positive shelf topping out near 69.  This plateau collapses into an extended, almost flat trench that occupies the high-70s through the 90s.  A renewed ascent produces twin crests at about 117 and 148, the latter the higher.  The line eases back toward zero, then tumbles into its deepest late-stage cavity centred close to index 185.  It ends with a hesitant recovery marked by several small ripples on either side of the axis.  
Best overall match: class 3  

signal 4  
Beginning on a modestly negative shelf, the trace surges upward to an early high at index 11, then slips into a slow, near-monotonic decay that crosses the axis in the low-40s and continues into a long, level negative terrace whose centre lies roughly in the 60-70 range.  A broad up-turn follows, lifting the record onto a wide flat top that peaks just above two units around index 103.  From that plateau the line slides steeply to a pronounced minimum near 140, after which it recovers to a smaller, late-stage crest about index 190 and drifts away in a mild decline.  
Best overall match: class 4

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
Beginning on a mildly negative shelf, the trace nicks a still lower notch at index 16, then sweeps upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 21.  From there it plunges into a broad negative basin whose floor sits between the high-30s and the mid-70s, lingering as a fairly level trench until it turns up again.  A steady climb carries the series to a secondary summit about index 120, after which it slides into another extended hollow spanning roughly indices 148-175.  The record then mounts a third marked peak at index 226 before fading away in a gently noisy decline, finishing a little on the positive side.  
Best–matching class: class_1  

Signal 2  
After a brief flat positive opening capped by small bumps at indices 1 and 19, the curve dives smartly through zero to its first deep trough at index 27.  It then settles into a long, almost level negative terrace that stretches from the low-30s well past index 100.  A broad, steady ascent follows, lifting the signal to a flat-topped ridge centred near index 150.  The series next slips into a steep decline that bottoms just after index 195, only to rebound again and crest around index 230 before easing off with gentle oscillations.  
Best–matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
The record opens on a mild near-zero ledge, dips further to a local minimum at index 28, then rises briskly through the axis to reach a first positive plateau whose high point comes near index 69.  It collapses into an extended, almost flat trench spanning roughly indices 75-90, climbs once more to twin crests at indices 97 and 157 (the latter the taller), then eases back toward zero.  A fresh fall carves a deep pocket centred close to index 185, after which a hesitant, ripple-filled recovery culminates in another peak about index 221 before the trace drifts away.  
Best–matching class: class_3  

Signal 4  
Opening just below zero, the trace rises through a pair of close early peaks at indices 11 and 14 (the second higher), then tumbles to its deepest valley at index 52.  It rebounds into a long, low-amplitude shelf that straddles the axis between roughly indices 65 and 90, pushes up to a moderate hump peaking near index 100 and a slightly broader crown that follows, and then sinks again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies between about indices 200 and 210.  At last the curve stages a gradual comeback, topping out near index 238 before tapering away in gentle undulations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening just a touch below the axis, the series pops up through a small first rise at index 2, drops back, then powers up a second and higher early crest at index 21.  From there it plunges sharply to its deepest negative pocket at index 40, and lingers in a long, almost level trough that stretches well past the century mark.  A steady climb lifts it to a mid-range summit about index 132, after which it slides again into an extended low table whose floor sits in the mid-170 s.  Finally the trace mounts a slow, persistent recovery that reaches its overall maximum near index 250 before ebbing away in mild noise.  
best fitting class: class_5  

signal 2  
The record starts on a brief positive shelf capped by modest bumps at indices 1 and 19.  It then falls abruptly to a first deep minimum at index 27 and settles into an unusually long, very flat negative terrace lasting into the low 100 s, interrupted only by a slightly deeper dip at about index 138.  A sudden rebound carries the curve to a strong crest near index 152, followed by a ragged slide into another negative bench running through the 170-200 range.  From there the signal rockets to its global peak around index 230, and ends in uneven, gradually diminishing oscillations straddling the axis.  
best fitting class: class_6 (no other template comes notably closer, though the match is imperfect)  

signal 3  
Beginning with small fluctuations a little below zero, the trace edges lower to a modest dip at index 22, then dives to its absolute minimum at index 28.  A brisk climb follows, producing a tall first crest at index 38.  After a gentle sag it settles on a positive shelf topping out near index 69, only to collapse into a broad flat trench that occupies the high-70 s through the 90 s.  The plot then rises in two steps, peaking at indices 96 and 157, the latter higher.  It eases back, sinks to a deep pocket centred near index 185, and finishes in a hesitant, rippling recovery that never recovers the earlier heights.  
best fitting class: class_3  

signal 4  
The curve opens slightly negative, surges quickly to an early high at index 11-14, and then declines almost monotonically, crossing the axis in the mid-40 s and sliding into a long, level negative shelf that occupies much of the 120-170 span.  Turning upward, it forms a broad, tall roof whose top sits at index 105, after which it plunges to a second, still deeper basin bottoming near index 220.  A late rebound raises a smaller crest close to index 200, and the trace subsides again, ending in modest, mixed-sign undulations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Beginning on a shallow negative ledge, the trace soon pokes above the axis with a modest bump around index 2, slips back a little deeper at 16, then vaults to a first pronounced crest at index 21 – the earliest major high.  From that summit it plunges rapidly to its overall minimum at index 40 and settles into a broad, almost ruler-flat negative table that stretches through roughly indices 50-90.  A steady climb follows, carrying the series to a secondary rounded ridge whose top lies near index 135.  The curve slips again into another hollow centred on the mid-170 s, then mounts a vigorous late-stage rally that culminates in a still higher crest close to index 247 before ebbing away toward the end.  
Best-fitting class: class_8  (alternative but less consistent: class_4)

signal 2  
After a brief negative flicker the curve rises into a low positive shelf that lasts to about index 18, then plunges abruptly to its deepest trough at index 24.  Instead of an immediate rebound it settles into an unusually long, almost level trench near –0.9 that runs from the low-30 s to well past index 120.  A patient, stepped ascent then begins, producing successive humps at indices 146, 160 and 162 before a sharper burst lifts the trace to its overall maximum near index 212.  From that late pinnacle the series undulates downward with ever-smaller swings, slipping a little below zero by the close.  
Best-fitting class: class_6 (though the fit is far from perfect; none of the reference shapes matches this record very closely)

signal 3  
The record opens just below the axis, hesitates for a few points and then dives to its deepest pocket at index 28.  A swift recovery carries it through zero and onto its first positive table, topping out near index 39.  That plateau erodes and by the high-70 s the trace has flattened into a wide, nearly level negative trench that lasts through the 80 s.  A second climb follows, posting crests at indices 97 and 158 (the latter higher), after which the curve eases back toward zero.  It falls again into a distinct hollow centred on indices 187-190 and ends with a hesitant sequence of ripples, none of which challenge the earlier highs.  
Best-fitting class: class_3

signal 4  
Starting a little below zero, the signal surges quickly to an early peak at index 12, then decays almost monotonically through the axis in the low-40 s to its first valley at index 52.  A gradual rise lifts it onto a low positive shelf spanning roughly indices 65-85, after which a renewed burst of strength drives it to its global maximum at index 109.  The trace then slides into a long, very flat negative terrace that occupies much of the 130-170 region.  A later rebound reaches a lesser crest near index 218, is followed by a steep fall to another deep pocket around index 238, and the record closes with a mild recovery.  
No reference class reproduces this combination of an early peak, a mid-range global maximum, an extended negative table and a small late crest; the signal does not match any of the eight exemplar shapes in a convincing way.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The series starts just below the axis, pops up to a first modest hump at index 2, slips back through zero to a shallow dip at 16, then shoots to an early and fairly tall crest about index 21. After a short breathing spell it plunges steeply into its deepest negative gulf in the low-40s and settles into a long, nearly level sub-zero bench that fills most of the 50s through the high-90s. A steady climb then carries it to a broad positive table centred near index 129. The trace rolls off again into a second extended hollow in the mid-160s before launching a powerful late-stage rally that reaches its overall maximum around index 222, afterwards fading gently.  
Best-matching class: class_5 (alternative, weaker fit: class_4)

Signal 2  
Following a brief positive shelf that tops between indices 1–19, the curve dives hard to its absolute minimum at index 27 and settles into an extraordinarily long, very flat negative terrace that lasts well past the hundred-mark. Only after index 140 does it break upward, climbing to a middling ridge about indices 148–166. A fresh sag bottoms in the mid-180s, then a second surge drives the trace to a late major peak near index 218. Thereafter it undulates downward in small waves, finishing slightly below zero.  
No reference class shows the same protracted mid-run flat floor combined with two late positive bursts, so this signal fails to match any given class convincingly.

Signal 3  
The record opens on a tiny positive ledge, but by index 29 it has plunged to its deepest trough. It rebounds explosively to a tall peak at index 39, relaxes, and swings negative again with hollows in the upper-70s and a still deeper pocket around 111. A brisk ascent then carries it to the global maximum at index 158; the line slips below zero near 185, and finally mounts another spirited climb that tops close to index 223 before easing lower.  
Best-matching class: class_7 (alternative: class_2)

Signal 4  
Commencing a little on the negative side, the trace climbs smartly to an early high at index 11, then decays almost monotonically, crossing the axis in the low-40s and settling into a broad negative terrace whose floor sits in the 50s–60s. It turns upward into a modest ridge around the high-60s, dips briefly, and then advances into a broad flat summit peaking near index 104. A pronounced decline bottoms in an extended negative shelf stretching through about indices 130–170. The signal then rebounds to a smaller late crest near index 220 before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
Opening barely below the axis, the trace lifts into a low positive shelf crowned by twin early crests at about indices 19 and 21 (the second the higher).  From there it plunges into its deepest valley, a sharp negative spike centred near index 40, then stretches out as a broad, almost level sub-zero table that lasts through roughly indices 50-100.  A steady climb follows, carrying the curve to a middle-stage summit around index 140 before it slides once more into a second long hollow focused in the mid-170s.  At last the series launches a vigorous late-period ascent that reaches the overall maximum close to index 225 and then ebbs away in a gentle decline.  
Best-matching class: class_5  

Signal 2  
The curve begins with a brief run of strong positive values, then tumbles abruptly to its global minimum near index 27 and settles into an extended flat negative terrace that stretches well past index 100.  A sudden rebound hoists it to a mid-range crest around index 170, after which it sags again into a further hollow in the low 200s.  A second, sharper up-swing sends the trace to a late peak close to index 230, and the record ends in a mild, uneven downturn.  
Best-matching class: (no convincing match among the eight reference patterns)  

Signal 3  
Starting on a faint positive ledge, the series dips a little further into the red by the low-20s before plunging to its overall minimum at index 28.  It then sweeps upward to its earliest and tallest crest around index 38, eases back and sinks into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs anew to a secondary summit near index 150, glides down into another shallow trough spanning roughly indices 170-178, and finally mounts a third marked peak at about index 223 before fading in a gentle, noisy decline.  
Best-matching class: class_1  

Signal 4  
Beginning slightly below zero, the trace rises briskly to an early high at index 11, then decays almost monotonically through the axis into a long level negative terrace covering the 50s and 60s.  Turning upward, it builds a broad, multi-headed flat top that culminates in a major crest near index 104, slips into a steady fall that bottoms around index 175, and finishes with a smaller late-stage crest close to index 210 before easing off toward the end.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
Opening on a faintly negative ledge, the trace lifts to a small crest at index 2, slips back through the axis to a shallow dip at 16, then vaults to an early, dominant peak about index 21. From that height it plunges to its deepest hollow near index 41, settles into a long, almost level negative table that lasts through roughly indices 50-100, and then mounts a steady climb to a broad rounded summit whose crown sits near index 149. The series slides away into another trough centred in the low-180s, rises again to a more modest late-stage hump around index 235, and finally drifts off in a gentle, slightly noisy decline.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 2  
After a brief sub-zero start the curve runs along a low positive shelf and makes a minor bump around index 19. It then dives abruptly to its global minimum at index 27 and remains pinned to an unusually flat negative terrace right through to about index 120. A stepped rebound lifts it to middling crests between indices 135 and 155, after which it sinks back below the axis to another trough near index 190. The record then rockets to its overall maximum at index 212 before tapering away in a wavering descent.  
Best-matching class: (no convincing match among the eight reference classes)  

Signal 3  
The series begins on a tiny positive shelf, plunges to a sharp minimum at index 28, and immediately surges to a tall first peak at index 38. It eases off, swings negative again and settles into an extended trough covering the high-70s through the low-90s. A vigorous rise follows, carrying the trace to a secondary crest near index 105 and an even higher global summit around index 170. It then falls once more into the negative in the mid-180s, before staging a fresh climb that culminates in another marked peak close to index 212 and fades thereafter.  
Best-matching class: class_7 (class_3 resembles parts of the course but lacks the repeated deep/lofted swings and late peak)  

Signal 4  
Starting just below zero, the signal leaps through paired early crests at indices 10 and 11 (the latter higher), tumbles to its deepest valley near index 55, and recovers into a long, low-amplitude shelf straddling the axis between about indices 70 and 80. It then turns upward into a broad, flat-topped ridge whose high point, at index 99, surpasses the opening peaks. From there the trace slides into a prolonged negative table with its floor in the mid-140s, and finally executes a measured comeback that tops out around index 204 before easing away toward the end.  
Best-matching class: class_5 (class_4 is a secondary possibility but the paired early peaks and late-stage recovery align more closely with class_5)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
From a slight sub-zero start the trace edges up to a modest bump at index 2, slips back, then sweeps higher through a pair of early peaks at indices 21 and 35 (the latter the taller).  It then plunges to its deepest trough at index 40 and loafs on an almost level negative table that runs through the mid-90s.  A steady climb lifts it onto a mid-range hump centred on indices 126-135, after which it idles on a shallow positive bench until about 150.  The curve slides once more into an extended hollow spanning roughly indices 171-190, and at last stages a powerful late-phase rally that crowns at index 249 before fading in gentle ripples toward the end.  
best-matching class: class_5  

signal 2  
After a short, mildly positive opening studded with small crests topping near index 19, the series dives head-long to its deepest pit at index 27.  It then lingers on a broad, almost flat sub-zero shelf that stretches well past the 100-mark.  A brisk rebound carries it to a mid-height crest around index 150, whereupon it wavers downward through a choppy basin in the 160s–170s.  Suddenly the curve rockets to its global maximum close to index 190, and thereafter undulates lower in shrinking swings, finishing just below the axis.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
The record begins on a small positive ledge, plunges quickly into a sharp negative well whose floor lies at index 28, and immediately launches sky-ward to an early towering crest at index 38.  It relaxes through a gentle descent, then collapses into a broad valley centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit near index 96 and to an even higher global peak at index 157, eases off, sinks to a fresh pocket around index 185, and finally mounts another brisk ascent that tops out near index 225 before ebbing away in minor undulations.  
best-matching class: class_7  

signal 4  
Beginning a little below zero, the trace races upward to an initial high at index 11, then decays almost monotonically, crossing the axis in the early 40s and dropping to a wide negative basin that bottoms at index 57.  A recovery lifts it onto a low positive shelf through the 70s, after which a fresh surge builds a broad flat top capped by the overall maximum at index 103.  The curve then slides into a long, level negative terrace spanning roughly indices 125-165, dips to a secondary low just short of index 190, and rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest near index 205 before tapering off.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record starts just below the axis, then rises through a pair of close early summits at about indices 21 and 35 (the first the higher).  From there it plunges to its deepest trough near index 40, after which it sits in a broad, almost level negative bench that lasts into the mid-90 s.  A steady climb then carries the trace up to a mid-height crest around index 144; this is followed by another long, fairly flat hollow lying roughly between indices 170 and 200.  Finally the series mounts a strong late-stage ascent that reaches its overall maximum close to index 235 and then ebbs away gently while remaining on the positive side.  
Best class match: class_5 (early paired peaks → deep valley → long low shelf → mid-range hump/plateau → prolonged negative table → late rebound to highest peak).

Signal 2  
After a brief dip below zero, the curve leaps onto a positive shelf near +1 that stretches through the first twenty samples.  It then dives sharply, settling into an unusually long, almost flat trench centred a little under –1 that occupies most indices from the low 30 s to the one-teens; the absolute minimum (≈ –1.4) occurs in the one-twenties.  A brisk recovery lifts the trace to a high crest of about +1.3 at index 132, followed by choppy oscillations that cross the axis several times.  A fresh descent in the 170 s is arrested by an energetic surge to the global maximum (≈ +1.7) near index 210, after which the signal drifts downward and finishes close to zero.  
Best class match: none of the eight reference patterns captures the very long early flat trench, the absence of mid-range crests, and the fact that the overall maximum arrives only in the 200 s; no reasonable fit.

Signal 3  
The series opens with mild, mixed flutter around the axis, then slips into a slightly deeper dip at about index 22 and falls precipitously to its greatest negative excursion (≈ –2.1) at index 28.  From there it climbs steadily, crossing into positive territory and topping out on an extended plateau that peaks near index 69.  A broad, flat negative trough follows, spanning roughly the high-70 s through the 90 s.  A renewed rise produces two well-separated crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter the higher).  After a brief easing the signal dives again to a deep pocket centred in the mid-180 s, then ends with a hesitant, ripple-filled recovery.  
Best class match: class_3 (sequence and relative positions of plateau, trench, twin crests and late pocket line up closely).

Signal 4  
The trace begins slightly negative but climbs quickly, reaching an early peak of about +1.6 at index 11.  It then decays more or less monotonically, crossing zero in the early-40 s and sliding to a first pronounced valley (≈ –1.4) near index 58.  A brisk rebound lifts it back above the axis into a low positive shelf that runs through the mid-80 s.  After a short dip in the 90 s the signal surges to its highest point (≈ +2.0) around index 106 and declines again, dropping into a very long, flat negative table that extends from roughly indices 128 to 170.  A secondary rise reaches a medium-height crest near index 191, but the curve soon turns down once more, descending into a deep, jagged basin in the 200 s before making a modest late recovery and closing just above zero.  
Best class match: none – the placement and number of terraces and peaks do not line up well with any reference class.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record starts on a faintly negative ledge, lifts to a small early bump near index 2, slips back only briefly, then drives hard upward to a paired crest the higher of which tops out close to index 21. From that early high the trace plunges to its deepest valley at about index 40, afterwards settling on an unusually flat negative table that lasts from roughly the low-50s into the high-80s. A measured climb returns the curve to the positive side, forming a low-amplitude shelf capped by a modest hump around index 120. It then slips into a second extended hollow spanning about indices 150-175 before rallying once more, this time mounting its late and overall tallest peak near index 235, after which it fades away in a gentle decline.  
Best-fitting class: class_5  

Signal 2  
After a brief dip the series leaps onto a shallow positive terrace that persists through about index 19, then dives sharply to reach its absolute minimum at index 27. Rather than recovering at once, it settles into an extraordinarily level negative plateau pinned close to –0.9 from the low-30s all the way past index 110. A slow, stepped ascent finally lifts it above the axis and flattens into a broad crown with secondary crests near indices 143 and 155. A steep slide bottoms out near index 175, followed by a rebound that forms a smaller late-stage hump just shy of index 190. Thereafter the line undulates lower, ending slightly below zero.  
Best-fitting class: class_4 (closest overall, though the last hump is somewhat larger than in the archetype)  

Signal 3  
The trace opens on a mild positive shelf, drops steadily to its global minimum at index 28, and then rockets upward to a tall early peak at index 38. Easing off, it crosses the axis, rises again into a lesser crest in the low-60s, then collapses into a broad negative pocket centred on indices 110-120. A brisk ascent produces a strong summit a little past index 150, after which the curve falls back through zero near index 175. In the closing stretch it stages another forceful climb that crests close to index 245 before subsiding in gentle ripples.  
Best-fitting class: class_7  

Signal 4  
Beginning with modest negative flickers, the signal crosses the axis and surges to a sizeable first maximum at index 11. A long, almost monotonic slide carries it through zero in the low-40s and down to a broad negative basin whose floor lies near index 58. It rebounds into a shallow plateau between indices 60 and 70, then rises still higher to its overall summit—a broad, flattened peak centred around index 99. From there the curve declines, settling into an extended negative shelf that stretches roughly from the mid-130s through the 170s. Finally it stages a late but smaller revival peaking near index 206, and then ebbs away toward the end.  
No reference class reproduces this sequence closely enough, so this signal is left unmatched.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Opening a shade below the axis, the curve pops over zero to a modest first bump at index 2, slips back to a small dip at 16, then rockets to its earliest major summit – a tall crest at index 21. It flickers through a lesser rise at 35 before plunging headlong into its broadest and deepest basin, whose flat floor near –1.0 stretches from roughly indices 40 to the high-90s. From the low-120s the trace climbs in orderly steps, breaking onto a secondary ridge that reaches its top about index 136, then moves forward along a low positive shelf until the early-160s. A sharp descent leads into another extended hollow centred near index 185, after which a long, vigorous recovery sets in, culminating in the overall maximum at index 250 before the record fades in a gentle decline.  
Best class fit: class_5  
  
signal 2  
A brief negative blip at the outset yields at once to a shallow positive shelf that lasts through index 19, where the first noticeable crest forms. The line then plunges abruptly into its deepest trough at index 27 and settles onto an extraordinarily prolonged, nearly level negative terrace that runs from the low-30s to about index 125. A sudden upswing lifts the trace into positive territory, crowning a broad ridge at index 137; it wavers, drops again into choppy sub-zero ground through the 160-190 range, and around index 208 surges still higher to its global peak. From there it drifts downward in smaller oscillations, ending close to the axis. No reference class displays both so long a mid-course flat valley and an even stronger second late-stage crest, so this signal does not align convincingly with any of the eight template patterns.  
Best class fit: (none)  
  
signal 3  
The record opens on a faint positive ledge, slides below zero and plunges to its deepest pocket at index 28, then rebounds in a brisk climb that tops out near index 38. After a brief lull it swings negative again, bottoming in another trough around index 75 and falling yet farther to a secondary floor at 117. A vigorous ascent then carries the trace to its overall maximum at index 157. It sags back under the axis near 186, but stages a fresh rise that peaks just past index 223 before tailing off. This ordered sequence of early floor at 24-30, peak around 40, double negative basins (~98 and 115) with the lower of the two deeper, dominant summit near 150, subsequent dip near 175-185 and final modest crest close to 220 corresponds closely to class_7.  
Best class fit: class_7  
  
signal 4  
Starting a little below zero, the curve shoots upward to an early high at index 11, then decays almost steadily, crossing the axis in the mid-40s and gliding down to a long, gently sloping negative bench whose floor lies near index 52 and extends into the 60s. Turning upward in the late-60s, it rolls onto a broad, flat crown whose global summit sits about index 112. A steep slide follows, reaching a deep pocket near 170 and lingering there as a flat shelf through the 180s, before the trace rebounds to a smaller, late-stage crest around index 235 and eases away. This pattern of early peak, protracted negative terrace, broad flat top in the low-130 vicinity, steep decline to a floor near 175 and a reduced final crest matches class_4 most closely.  
Best class fit: class_4

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace opens a little below the axis, pops to a first modest crest at index 2, droops through zero and touches an early floor at 16, then lifts in a steady sweep to its tallest early pinnacle around 21. From there it plunges headlong into a broad, very deep negative basin whose lowest point sits near index 40 and extends as an almost level shelf until roughly the low-100s. A long climb follows, carrying the curve to a secondary summit at about 128, after which it slides into another extended hollow centred in the low-170s. A new ascent mounts a third marked peak close to index 230; afterwards the trace ebbs away in a gently noisy decline back toward the negative side.  
Best-matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
Beginning just under zero the series leaps immediately to paired early crests at indices 1 and 19 (the second the higher), then dives steeply to its deepest trough at index 27. It settles on an extended, almost level negative table (about −0.9) that lasts from the low 30s into the mid-110s, dips briefly a little lower near 127, and finally turns upward. A moderate hump rises near 129–135, is followed by a ragged fall into another negative stretch that bottoms in the 170s, and then a long, determined rally drives the record to its overall maximum at index 210. The curve finishes with small oscillations, ending close to the axis.  
Broadly this sequence of paired early highs, deepest valley, zero-straddling shelf, mid-range hump, second negative table, and a late comeback crest fits best with class 5 (though the absolute indices are shifted forward relative to the template).  
Best-matching class: class_5  

signal 3  
The record starts on a mild negative shelf, subsides to a sharp minimum at index 28, and then soars through the axis to a first strong crest at 38. It relaxes gradually, then collapses into an extended flat trench spanning roughly indices 75–90. A recovery brings twin crests, the first at about 96 and a higher one at 157, with a smaller rise around 149 between them. After easing back toward zero the curve slips into another deep pocket in the 110s, and the final portion shows a hesitant revival peppered with minor ripples and a brief high patch near index 172 before the trace subsides.  
Best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
Starting on a moderate positive ledge the signal climbs quickly to an early high at index 11, then decays almost monotonically, crossing the axis in the early-40s and sliding to a long, fairly level negative terrace (about −0.85) that stretches through the 120s. Turning upward again, it forms a broad, flat-topped ridge whose crown, at about index 97, is the global peak. A steep descent reaches its lowest point near 155, but the series rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest around index 177 before easing off in a shallow decline.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace begins a touch below the axis, lifts through a first low crest at index 2, eases, then drives higher to a taller early peak at index 21.  It then plunges steeply to its overall minimum at index 39 and settles into a broad, almost level negative table that stretches through roughly indices 60-90.  From there it climbs steadily to a secondary ridge occupying the mid-120s to mid-130s, slips back into a second extended hollow centred in the 160s-170s, and finally mounts a long, deliberate recovery whose third marked summit appears close to index 250, after which it dwindles in gentle ripples.  
Best-matching class: class_5 (the opening pair of peaks, the deep valley, the near-zero/negative shelf, the later hump-plus-plateau, the long negative table in the 160s and the late-stage comeback line up most closely with the class-5 outline).

signal 2  
After a very short mixed beginning the curve leaps to an early high at index 1, then slides almost monotonically into its first and deepest trough near index 28.  It levels into a long flat negative terrace that persists well past index 120 before rising to a moderate crest about index 148.  A further dip follows, but the signal then launches into a still higher summit in the neighbourhood of index 249.  From that late pinnacle it ebbs away with ever-smaller oscillations, ending a little below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_4 (early crest, lengthy negative shelf, mid-course shoulder, steep later rise to a bigger peak, and a tail that fades beneath the axis correspond most closely to the class-4 pattern; class_2 is a weaker alternative).

signal 3  
The series opens slightly positive, hesitates, and dives to its deepest pocket at index 28, whereupon it rockets to a tall peak near index 39.  It relaxes, swings negative again with a trough in the mid-70s, falls still farther to a secondary floor at index 117, then mounts a brisk ascent that reaches the global maximum around index 150.  A fresh decline carries it below the axis near index 175, and a late rebound crowns a third peak close to index 232 before the record subsides.  
Best-matching class: class_7 (the early dive/peak pair, sequential double troughs, mid-course highest crest, later dip and final rebound mirror the class-7 description very closely).

signal 4  
Beginning just below zero, the trace climbs briskly to a first crest at index 11, then drops through the axis and bottoms out in its deepest trough in the low-50s.  A recovery hoists it to an intermediate shoulder in the 70s, after which it surges higher to its overall maximum near index 101.  It then slides into a ragged descent that settles into an extended negative shelf spanning roughly indices 130-170, and finally musters a modest late-stage hump around index 232 before tapering off to finish a shade below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_2 (sequence of early bump, main trough, middling crest, higher peak, post-peak descent with smaller swings, and a finish a little under the axis matches class-2 best; class_4 would be a distant secondary possibility).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening just below the axis, the trace pops up to a small crest at index 2, relaxes, then rolls higher to a taller twin-peak pair at indices 21 and 35 (the second the larger). From there it plunges headlong to its deepest valley at index 40 and settles into an extended, almost ruler-flat negative shelf that runs from the low-50s to the high-80s. A steady climb follows, topping a moderate rounded summit about index 126, after which the line lingers as a subdued positive table through the 130s. It then slides into a broad negative bench whose floor lies in the mid-160s, and finally mounts a long, gradual comeback that culminates in a late high around index 239 before tapering away in mild noise.  
best fit → class_5  

signal 2  
The series starts out on a gently elevated positive ledge, hitting an initial high near index 3 and staying aloft until roughly index 19. It then declines almost monotonically, crossing zero in the mid-20s and slipping into a long, flat negative terrace centred near index 70 that persists for close to a hundred points. A measured up-slope carries the trace to a broad, gently undulating plateau whose crown sits around index 140. This is followed by a sharp descent that bottoms just past index 170. A brisk rebound produces a secondary crest a little before index 200, after which the curve drifts downward again with progressively smaller swings.  
best fit → class_4  

signal 3  
The record opens on a faintly negative shelf, slips a shade deeper to a local floor at index 28, then sweeps upward through the axis to its first prominent crest at index 38. After easing only slightly it holds a positive table that tops out near index 68. A sudden collapse carries the line into an extended, nearly level trench spanning roughly indices 100–120. From there it climbs to paired summits at indices 150 and 159 (the latter higher), glides back toward zero, drops into a deep pocket centred in the high-180s, and finishes with a hesitant recovery mottled by minor ripples and late small peaks.  
best fit → class_3  

signal 4  
Beginning on a gentle negative shelf, the curve makes a brief early dip, then rockets to a sizeable crest at index 11. It drifts downward through small steps, crosses the axis in the 40s, and settles into a modest basin that reaches its deepest point at index 58. A vigorous rise lifts it onto a mid-range ledge around indices 65–80, followed by a further surge that delivers the overall maximum at index 105. Thereafter the trace declines in a wavering slide that bottoms in a negative pocket centred close to index 123, rises to a minor hump near index 162, slips again, and finally mounts a strong late climb to a second major peak near index 205 before easing toward the end.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Opening a fraction below the axis, the record flicks up to a modest bump at index 2, slips back, then climbs smartly to a higher early crest about index 21.  From there it tumbles headlong into its lowest point at index 40 and extends into a wide, almost level negative shelf that persists through roughly the 50s-80s.  A steady, staircase-like rise lifts the trace through zero to a mid-height ridge whose top sits close to index 120, after which it slides again into a broad negative terrace centred in the 160s-170s.  At length the series turns upward once more, mounting its overall maximum near index 225, and thereafter ebbs away with gentle scatter toward the end.  
Best-matching class: class_5  

Signal 2  
The curve begins with a sustained positive ledge (values near one) lasting to about index 19, then plunges abruptly to a deep trough at index 27.  It stays locked in an unusually flat negative table (≈ –0.9) for almost a hundred samples, breaks out in a swift ascent that culminates in a temporary summit close to index 136, and quickly subsides.  A second slide carves an even deeper pocket around index 193, after which the trace rockets to its global peak near index 206.  From that late high it drifts lower in diminishing ripples, ending just under the zero line.  
This overall shape does not correspond closely to any of the eight reference patterns, so no confident class assignment is made.  

Signal 3  
Starting on a slight positive shelf, the series sinks steadily to its deepest trough at index 28, then soars to a tall peak at index 38.  It relaxes, dips negative again with a pocket centred near index 75, rebounds to a lesser crest around index 69, slips once more into a sharper hollow whose floor lies near index 110, and then mounts a brisk ascent that delivers the global maximum at index 157.  A fresh decline carries the trace below zero in the mid-180s, but another late climb peaks close to index 224 before the signal finally subsides.  
Best-matching class: class_7 (class_2 is a distant alternative)  

Signal 4  
The record opens mildly negative, swings up through zero and reaches an early high at index 11, then drifts downward, crossing the axis again in the low-40s.  It settles into a long, almost level negative terrace extending through the 80s-90s, turns upward into a broad, slightly rounded plateau whose crown lies near index 109, and thereafter drops steeply to a negative floor in the mid-170s.  A later rebound produces a smaller secondary crest around index 209, after which the trace declines once more and fades out in gentle fluctuations.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
A mild negative opening turns upward almost at once, giving a first low crest at index 2 and a markedly higher early summit at index 21.  From there the curve plunges to its deepest hollow at index 40 and sits in a broad, almost level negative table that lasts into the low 100 s.  A steady climb then carries the trace back above the axis into a long shallow positive shelf centred roughly on indices 125-140, after which it slides again into another extended sub-zero terrace between about 160 and 180.  At the close of that hollow the series rallies strongly, reaching a late and overall highest peak near index 235, then ebbs away in a gentle, slightly noisy decline.  
Best–matching class: class_8  

Signal 2  
The record begins on a short positive ledge punctuated by a modest hump (highest there about index 19), then dives sharply through zero to its first major trough at index 27.  What follows is an unusually long, very flat negative plateau (roughly indices 30-115).  A sudden steep ascent produces a broad positive table spanning the 125-145 region, topped by crests close to indices 128 and 142.  The trace then falls away again, hitting another deep pocket just after index 180, before mounting a second, still higher burst that culminates in the global maximum around index 197.  Thereafter the curve undulates downward with smaller swings, ending fractionally below zero.  
This overall sequence does not match any of the supplied prototype descriptions closely enough – no class assigned.  

Signal 3  
After a brief, slightly negative shelf the curve slides to a sharp minimum at index 28, then rockets to a tall peak at index 38.  It relaxes, swings negative again to a trench near index 75, falls still further to its absolute low at index 117, and then mounts a brisk ascent that reaches the global maximum around index 157.  A fresh decline carries the signal back below the axis near index 175, but a late-stage climb peaks once more close to index 223 before the series finally subsides.  
Best–matching class: class_7  

Signal 4  
The trace starts a little below the axis, rises quickly to an early high at index 11, and eases downward, crossing zero in the low-40 s and dipping to a local floor near index 58.  A mild recovery lifts it onto a low-amplitude positive shelf that stretches through the 70-90 region, after which a stronger up-sweep forms a broad plateau whose summit (and overall maximum) lies near index 106.  From there the signal descends steeply into a long negative table (approximately indices 130-175), then rebounds to a smaller late crest around index 210 before tapering off toward the end.  
None of the reference classes reproduces this particular ordering and spacing of features convincingly – no class assigned.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening on a shallow negative shelf, the trace flips almost immediately upward, bending through a small positive bump near index 2, slips back to a local floor about index 16, then sweeps steeply into its earliest and tallest crest around index 21. From there it wavers, posting a lesser rise close to index 35 before plunging head-first into its deepest, broad negative basin whose flat bottom occupies the low-40s through roughly index 100. A long recovery hoists the series to a secondary summit near index 139, after which it slides into another extended hollow centred in the mid-180s. A renewed climb mounts a third marked peak a little past index 260, and the record finally drifts away in a gently noisy decline.  
Best fitting class: class_1  

signal 2  
The curve begins with a brief dip below zero but almost instantly settles on a broad, low-ripple positive ledge that lasts to about index 19. It then dives precipitously, punching through an early deep trough just before index 30 and, instead of rebounding, sinks onto an extraordinarily flat negative table that stretches, almost featureless, all the way to roughly index 120. At that point the trace bolts upward to a high crest around index 139, meanders downward through smaller oscillations, slips negative again, then mounts a still higher late-stage peak near index 210 before ebbing back toward the axis. None of the reference patterns shows this very long, featureless negative table followed by the pair of widely spaced positive crests, so the signal does not convincingly match any of the eight classes.  
Best fitting class: (no satisfactory match)  

signal 3  
The record opens with mild, near-zero flutter, eases down slightly through the teens, and plunges to a sharp global minimum at index 29. A brisk rebound rockets to a first strong crest about index 37, after which the wave settles into a gentle positive shelf topping out near index 69. It collapses into a flat negative trench spanning the high-70s through the late 80s, then climbs again to twin crests at indices 101 and about 163 (the latter higher). After a brief easing it falls into another deep pocket centred roughly at index 120, and finally staggers upward once more, sprinkling minor ripples across its closing stretch.  
Best fitting class: class_3  

signal 4  
Starting a little below zero, the signal climbs smartly, reaching an early maximum at index 11. It then decays almost monotonically, crossing the axis in the mid-40s and sliding onto a long, nearly level negative terrace whose floor, around –0.85, extends through the 80s. A broad, multi-headed rise carries the curve to a flat-topped high plateau peaking near index 107, from which it tumbles in a steep descent that bottoms in the mid-170s. A modest late rebound forms a smaller crest close to index 200 before the trace eases away toward the finish.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace starts a touch below zero, rises immediately to a small bump near index 2, slips back into a shallow dip about index 16, then drives steeply upward to a taller early summit around index 21.  It plunges straight afterwards to its global minimum at index 40 and settles into an extraordinarily long, almost level negative shelf that lasts through roughly indices 50–140.  A steady recovery then lifts the curve to a moderate crest in the high-170s, followed by another descent that forms a second extended hollow centred in the low-220s.  From the mid-250s the signal climbs once more, plateaus just under 1 for a short stretch, and crowns the run with a late and highest peak close to index 290 before tapering off.  
Best class match: class_5 (class_1 is a much weaker alternative).

signal 2  
Beginning with a brief positive platform that tops out near indices 1–19, the series dives abruptly to a deep trough at index 24 and settles into a very long, flat negative terrace (about –0.87) extending from the low-30s to roughly index 140.  A vigorous rebound lifts it to a modest ridge around indices 160–170, but the line soon slides again, reaching a second and still lower pocket in the 210s.  At about index 233 it surges sharply to its overall maximum, then undulates downward with alternating mild rises and falls, ending near the axis.  
None of the reference patterns follows this sequence closely enough; no convincing class match can be assigned.

signal 3  
The record opens on a slightly positive ledge, collapses to a first deep minimum at index 28, then rockets to a tall peak at index 38.  After easing back it swings negative again, touching another trough in the mid-70s and falling still further to its absolute low near index 117.  A brisk climb propels the trace to its global maximum about index 157; it then declines into the negative in the 180s before mounting a late-stage rise that peaks close to index 224 and finally subsides.  
Best class match: class_7 (class_2 resembles the early part but diverges later).

signal 4  
Starting on a mild negative shelf, the signal climbs steadily to an early high at index 11, then decays almost monotonically, crossing zero in the mid-40s and slipping into a long, flat negative terrace centred on indices 80–90.  A broad, flat-topped rise follows, reaching a higher plateau with its summit near index 106–110.  From there the curve drops sharply, hitting its deepest point around index 175, before rebounding to a smaller, late crest near index 230 and fading in a gentle decline.  
Best class match: class_4.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record begins a little below the axis, nips briefly upward to a modest crest at index 2, slips back a shade, then surges again to a considerably higher early summit at index 21. From there it dives head-first to its overall minimum at index 40, after which it settles into a very long, almost ruler-flat negative ledge that stretches from the mid-40s to almost index 100. A steady climb sets in after index 120, carrying the trace through zero and onto a low, gently waving positive mesa whose top lies between about 135 and 155. A fresh slide returns the curve to a second extended hollow centred roughly on indices 170-190. At index 212 it crosses the axis once more and levels into another quiet shelf just under +1, before breaking free into its highest peak of the whole run at index 244. The series then ebbs away in a shallow, slightly noisy descent.  
Closest match: none of the eight reference shapes reproduces both the dual long plateaux (one deep negative, one shallow positive) and the late global maximum, so no reasonable class assignment is made.

Signal 2  
After opening a touch below zero the trace jumps immediately into a cluster of small crests, topping the first group with a local high at index 19. A sharp plunge follows, bottoming at index 27; from the low-30s clear through to about index 145 the curve clings almost unwaveringly to a narrow negative shelf a little under the axis. A lower notch is carved at index 148, then the signal bursts upward, climbing to a mid-range peak at index 158 and throwing off two further positive bumps at indices 174 and 177. What follows is a ragged descent marked by several secondary pits, the deepest of them at index 216. A powerful late-stage rally drives the series to its overall maximum at index 229 before it subsides again in choppy oscillations and finishes close to the axis.  
Closest match: none – the very long, nearly level negative shelf followed by a late global maximum is not characteristic of any reference class.

Signal 3  
The sequence opens just under the axis, slips a little lower at index 22, then plunges to its deepest trough at index 28. It rebounds strongly, arching steadily upward through zero to form a first broad positive plateau whose crown lies in the low-60s (peaking near index 69). A sudden collapse dumps the trace into an extended, almost level trench that spans the high-70s through the 90s. From there it climbs again, posting successive crests near indices 96 and 148, the latter noticeably higher. After a brief easing it sinks to another pronounced pocket around index 188, then stages a hesitant, rippling recovery that includes a cluster of late but smaller highs in the 220s before tapering away.  
Best-fitting reference: class_3.

Signal 4  
An initial string of negatives gives way to a quick ascent that reaches an early high at index 11. From that point the curve decays almost monotonically, sliding through zero in the low-40s and down into a long, level negative terrace whose floor sits around index 130. A forceful revival then carries it upward into a broad, nearly flat-topped positive mesa centred on index 104–105 (the global maximum appears at index 104). A steep decline follows, driving the trace to its deepest pit close to index 228. The series then rebounds toward a smaller late-stage crest at index 258 before easing back once more in a gentle fade.  
Best-fitting reference: class_4 (the early high, protracted negative terrace, broad mid-run flat top, late secondary crest and final fade correspond most closely, though individual index numbers are shifted forward by about 20–25 samples).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record begins slightly below the axis and at once pops up to a modest crest at index 2.  It then slips to a shallow dip at 16 before vaulting smartly to its first and tallest summit around 21.  After hovering in the upper region through the mid-20s the trace plunges head-long into its deepest hollow at about 40, settling into an extended, almost level negative table that stretches well past index 80.  From there it climbs in a long, even sweep to a second pronounced peak near 131 and idles on a mild positive shelf into the mid-150s.  A renewed slide carries it into another broad depression centred in the mid-170s, but the curve revives once more, driving to a third marked crest close to index 259 before fading away in a gentle, somewhat noisy descent.  
Best overall fit: class_5 (early double crest, deep early valley, mid-range hump/plateau, late revival peak).

Signal 2  
A brief positive plateau (indices 0-19) culminates in a low-level crest about 19, after which the signal dives abruptly to its first and deepest trough at 27.  It stays locked for many tens of points in a very flat negative terrace (roughly indices 30-120).  A steady climb then carries it back through the axis, reaching a moderate ridge around 144.  The line wavers, falls again into rough ground in the 170-200 range—hitting another sharp low near 206—then bursts upward to its overall maximum near 221.  From that late high it meanders downward in diminishing oscillations to the finish just below zero.  
No published prototype reproduces this exact sequence of a very long early negative shelf followed by a late, largest peak; none of the eight reference classes match convincingly.

Signal 3  
The series opens on small, near-zero undulations that step gradually downward to a sharp global minimum at index 28.  It rebounds forcefully to a broad positive plateau crowned at index 38, eases only slightly, then rises again to a second, flatter roof that tops out near 69.  A long, level trench of almost constant depth occupies the low-70s into the 90s.  A renewed ascent produces twin crests at about 102 and 165 (the latter the higher), followed by an easing toward the axis and a deep pocket centred just beyond 200.  The trace ends with a hesitant recovery sprinkled with minor ripples.  
Best overall fit: class_3.

Signal 4  
Starting a little below zero, the curve rockets to an early high near index 11, then sinks steadily, crossing the axis in the low-40s and bottoming sharply around 52.  A brisk rebound builds to a broad, flat-topped global peak centred on index 99, after which the trace descends again, settling into a very long, almost level negative shelf that lasts from roughly 120 to 165.  A steep dip carries it to another low in the 190s, followed by a moderate late-stage crest near 188 and a gradual tail-off.  
The ordering and spacing of these features (early peak, mid-course plateau at 100, negative terrace far later than 80-90, and a late crest that is not smaller than the mid-course one) do not line up well with any of the reference classes; this signal appears unmatched.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace opens on a small negative ledge, pops above the axis almost at once and makes a first little crest at index 2.  After hesitating it slips to a shallow trough at 16, then sweeps upward into its first big summit at 21 – the tallest height reached so far.  A sharp plunge carries it to an abrupt deep valley at 40, which spreads into a long flat negative table lasting through roughly the mid-70s.  From there the curve climbs steadily, topping out on a secondary peak around index 110, slides back into another broad, nearly level hollow centred near 150, and finally mounts a third, still higher, crest close to index 195 before easing off in a mildly noisy decline.  
Best-matching class: class_8  (alternative that also resembles the shape, though less closely: class_1)

Signal 2  
A brief positive shelf leads to a pair of early humps (the larger at index 19) before the signal plunges to its deepest pit at 27.  It then settles into an extremely long, almost featureless negative terrace that stretches to about index 120.  A brisk recovery follows, carrying the trace up to a moderate crest near 150; this is short-lived, as the series sinks again, touching another sharp low round 200.  At the very end the curve stages a long slow comeback that culminates in its overall maximum close to index 225, then tails away toward the axis.  
Best-matching class: class_5

Signal 3  
Beginning with a tiny positive shelf, the series collapses quickly to a pronounced minimum at index 28, then rockets to a tall peak at 38.  After relaxing it swings negative again, bottoming round 110, dips even lower to its absolute floor at 117, and then climbs briskly to its global maximum about index 157.  A renewed fall carries it below zero near 175, but a fresh late-stage surge produces another crest just past 215 before the record subsides.  
Best-matching class: class_7

Signal 4  
The record starts slightly below zero but rises smartly, reaching an early high at index 11.  From there it drifts downward, crossing the axis in the low-40s and digging out a broad negative bench whose floor lies near 60.  A steady up-slope then lifts the trace to a wide, flat-topped plateau between about 90 and 100 where it attains its overall summit at 97.  A protracted slide follows, leading to an extended level negative terrace from roughly 120 to the high-160s, after which the curve dives more steeply to its lowest point close to index 175.  It rebounds into a smaller late crest in the vicinity of 190-200 and finally eases back in a gentle fall.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record opens a hair below the axis, vaulting to a first, modest crest at index 2 and to a noticeably higher crest at index 21.  From there the trace tumbles abruptly to its global minimum at index 40 and settles into an unusually long, almost ruler-flat negative table that stretches through about index 110.  A steady climb lifts the curve to a secondary summit near index 124, after which it slides once more into a broad hollow whose floor lies in the mid-160s.  At last it embarks on a protracted late-stage recovery that culminates in the overall highest peak close to index 229 before ebbing in a gentle, slightly noisy decline.  
Best matching class: class_5  

Signal 2  
A brief positive prelude capped by small crests up to index 19 is followed by a head-long dive to the deepest trough at index 27.  The signal then settles onto a remarkably long, almost level negative shelf a touch below −0.9 that spans roughly indices 31-115.  Emerging from this flat, it meanders upward, posting medium-height crests around indices 140 and 160 and its absolute maximum—about index 175—before sagging again.  The closing section oscillates with shrinking swings and ends a shade under zero.  
This overall shape (early modest peaks, exceptionally prolonged flat depression, very late tallest peak) does not correspond closely to any of the reference patterns.  

Signal 3  
Starting just above zero, the curve dips lightly and then plunges to its deepest valley at index 29.  It rebounds briskly to an initial crest at index 38, relaxes only briefly, then pushes higher to a broader top in the mid-60s.  A choppy slide bottoms a little past index 110, whereupon the trace rockets to its global maximum near index 158.  Thereafter it undulates downward, slipping into smaller swings, yet still fires one more sharp spike at indices 181-182 before gradually fading toward the axis.  
Best matching class: class_2  

Signal 4  
The series begins in mild negative territory but surges quickly to an early high at indices 11-14.  A slow decay carries it through zero in the low-40s and into a broadening basin that reaches its first significant floor at index 58.  A swift rebound produces a positive shelf in the mid-60s, then a still taller crest—the overall maximum—at index 103.  A gradual fall ensues, leading to another wide negative pocket centred a little past index 120 and followed by a prolonged flat terrace around −0.85 that lasts into the 160s.  After a brief dip it mounts a fresh climb to a secondary peak near index 200, then slides once more into deeper negatives before a final, smaller late uplift and a muted finish.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace starts on a mildly negative shelf, rises through several faint ripples and reaches a first and strongest crest at about index 21.  From there it slides steeply through the axis into its widest, flattest negative bench, which stretches almost unbroken from the mid-40s to the low-90s (deepest point near index 40).  A steady climb then carries the record back above zero into a broad, nearly level positive mesa whose crown lies between indices 139-150.  The curve then dives again, carving out a second hollow centred near index 175, rebounds to a smaller late-stage hump a little after index 210, and finally drifts upward in scattered ripples, touching a last modest peak around index 238 before easing away.  
Best matching class: class_4  

Signal 2  
After a short positive ledge that throws up a handful of minor bumps (up to index 19), the series plunges sharply through zero to a deep minimum at index 24, then settles into an exceptionally long, almost flat negative terrace that occupies the entire stretch from the low-30s into the low-110s.  A slow, stepped ascent follows: a first clear summit appears near index 140, the line oscillates downward again—with fresh negative pockets in the 170-190 region—then executes a late surge to its overall maximum around index 220.  Thereafter it meanders downward in small waves and finishes only slightly below the axis.  
Best matching class: (no convincing match among the eight reference patterns)  

Signal 3  
The record opens on a very shallow positive shelf, dips slightly further into negative ground at about index 22 and then crashes to its global minimum near index 28.  A swift rise launches it to an early tall crest at index 38, after which it relaxes only briefly before climbing again to a broad positive table that tops out close to index 67.  From there the signal collapses into an extended, almost level trench that spans the high-70s through the 90s.  Renewed strength produces two successive peaks at roughly indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), followed by an easing toward zero, a sharp pocket centred in the mid-180s, and, finally, a hesitant, ripple-laden recovery toward the close.  
Best matching class: class_3  

Signal 4  
Beginning just below zero, the curve rockets upward through a pair of early crests at indices 11 and 14 (the second the higher), then plunges to its deepest valley at index 58.  A brisk rebound ushers in a long, low-amplitude shelf that hovers around the axis between about indices 66 and 90, which in turn swells to a moderate hump near index 97 and a broader, flatter crown peaking around index 105.  The trace then descends into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies throughout the 140s and 160s, before staging a gradual, stair-step comeback that attains a final summit close to index 225 and declines gently thereafter.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace opens a little below zero, rises to a modest hump at index 2, slips back into a shallow dip around 16, then soars to a first and clearly higher crest at index 21.  From there it slides steeply into its deepest valley at index 40, continuing as an extended, almost level negative shelf that lasts through roughly the mid-70s.  A steady climb then carries the series across the axis to a secondary summit close to index 116, followed by a low-amplitude positive table that stretches to about 145.  The curve next sinks into another broad hollow centred in the 160s–170s, but rebounds smartly, reaching a third and final prominent peak near index 220 before drifting downward in a mild, noisy fade.  
Best overall fit: class_5  (alternative that also resembles parts of the outline: class_8)

Signal 2  
After a brief positive patch (indices 0-16) the record plunges to its global minimum at index 27, then settles into a very long, nearly flat negative terrace that persists to well past index 110.  Abruptly, at index 140, the trace rockets upward to its overall maximum.  Thereafter it oscillates downward with several medium-sized swings, finishing a little above the axis.  Because none of the reference patterns include such a prolonged early flat trough followed by a single late-stage burst, this signal does not match any of the eight classes convincingly.  
Best match: none of the given classes

Signal 3  
The series starts on a small negative ledge, dips to a still deeper pocket at index 28, then mounts a strong, uninterrupted ascent that crests first at index 38.  It eases only briefly before climbing again, topping a broad positive shelf that ends near index 69.  A long, almost level trench follows through the high-70s and 80s.  From there the curve rises in two steps to peaks at indices 96 and 151 (the latter higher), eases toward zero, dives into a deep, flat hole centred around index 117-120, and later into another at about 185, before staging a hesitant multi-wave recovery whose tallest late pulse stands at index 179-180.  
Best overall fit: class_3

Signal 4  
Beginning just below the axis, the curve quickly breaks into the positive and reaches an early high at index 11–14.  It then declines almost monotonically, crossing zero in the early-40s and slipping to a long, fairly level negative table that bottoms near index 60.  A renewed climb takes the signal to a broad, gently rounded top that peaks at index 100 and stays positive through roughly 110–115.  A steep fall carries the trace to another extended negative shelf that spans about indices 130–180, where it finds its deepest floor.  Finally, the record rebounds to a smaller, late-stage crest a little past index 205 before slackening once more.  
Best overall fit: class_4  (though the timing of individual features is somewhat earlier than in the reference)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
Beginning just below zero, the waveform shoots upward through two quick early crests at about indices 2 and 21 (the latter distinctly higher).  From there it tumbles head-long to its overall minimum at index 40 and settles into a long, almost ruler-flat negative bench that stretches from roughly the low-50s into the high-80s.  A steady climb then lifts the trace to a moderate rounded summit around index 127, after which it slides once more into an extended negative table whose floor lies in the 160s.  Turning upward again, it rises through a first late-stage hump near index 205 and on to its final – and highest – peak close to index 233, before ebbing away in a gentle decline.  
Best-matching class: class_5  

Signal 2  
The curve opens on a short positive shelf lasting to about index 20, then plunges sharply to its deepest hollow at index 27.  It next spreads into an exceptionally long, level negative terrace that occupies the low-30s clear through roughly index 120.  A brisk ascent follows, carrying the trace to a broad flat top centred near index 140.  From there it slides into a steep negative basin that bottoms in the mid-150s, rebounds to a secondary ridge in the high-170s, dips again to another pocket just past index 200, and finally stages a late comeback that crests near index 230 before drifting back toward zero.  
Best-matching class: class_4  (no other class fits as well, though several details differ)  

Signal 3  
After hovering a little below the axis the record makes a shallow extra dip at index 22, then climbs steadily through zero into a first high plateau that tops out near index 38 and runs forward to about index 69.  It then collapses abruptly into a broad, almost level trench extending from the mid-70s through the low-90s.  Renewed ascent brings twin crests at indices 96 and 157 (the latter the loftier), followed by easing toward the axis and a fresh plunge into a deep pocket around index 185.  The trace ends with a hesitant recovery sprinkled with minor ripples and a small late bulge in the mid-220s.  
Best-matching class: class_3  

Signal 4  
Starting in mild negative territory and slipping to a brief local dip at index 3, the signal accelerates upward to an early major crest at index 11.  It then decays through zero in the early-40s and settles into a modest negative basin whose deepest point lies near index 58.  A steady climb carries it onto a gently elevated shelf that spans the high-60s through the mid-80s; after a brief wobble it surges to a broad, lofty plateau that peaks around index 106.  The trace subsequently falls into a long, fairly level negative pocket centred on indices 130-150, mounts a smaller hump near index 175, drops to its sharpest trough close to index 195, and finally rallies once more to a second substantial peak just after index 220 before easing off.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace opens slightly below the axis, pops up to a modest bump at index 2, slips back to a shallow dip around 16, then vaults sharply to its first major crest at index 21. It drops away into a broad, deep negative basin whose floor lies in the low-40s and, after lingering there, settles into a long flat negative table that runs through roughly indices 45–120. From that plain the curve climbs in a stepped rise to a mid-height plateau cresting just past index 140, slides once more into an extended hollow spanning about 178–200, and finally launches a powerful late-stage surge that carries it to its overall maximum near index 261 before ebbing gradually.  
Best matching class: class_8  

Signal 2  
Beginning with a low-amplitude positive shelf that lasts into the high teens, the series plunges abruptly through zero, reaching its first deep trough at index 27. It then stretches out into an unusually long, almost level negative trench that persists from the early-30s to roughly index 100. A slow rebound lifts the line to a modest hill centred near 123, after which it sinks again, bottoming more decisively around index 192. Out of this second hollow the signal rockets upward to its absolute peak at about index 207, and thereafter subsides in smaller, wavering oscillations, finishing very close to the axis.  
Fit with none of the eight reference patterns is convincing – no clear match.  

Signal 3  
The record starts on a mild negative shelf, dips a little further at index 22, and then rises smoothly through zero to a first positive terrace that tops out near index 69. It collapses into an extended flat negative ditch extending through the high-70s and 90s, climbs again to paired crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter the higher), eases back toward zero, sinks to a pronounced pocket around index 185, and ends with a hesitant, ripple-speckled recovery.  
Best matching class: class_3  

Signal 4  
After opening just below zero the curve climbs quickly to an early high around index 11, then drifts downward almost monotonically, crossing the axis in the mid-40s and forming a shallow negative shelf between about 50 and 60. A renewed ascent builds into a broad rounded summit centred in the mid-90s, followed by a head-long tumble that finds its deepest floor in the low 200s. The signal then rebounds to a smaller, late-phase crest near index 227 before fading away in a gentle decline.  
Its sequence of events and timing diverge noticeably from every exemplar; no satisfactory correspondence with the eight classes can be drawn.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace opens fractionally below zero, flips quickly up to a modest hill at index 2, then slips to a deeper negative dip at 16. From there it climbs in a smooth arc to its tallest crest at 21, eases only briefly, and dives head-long to the global minimum at 40. What follows is a broad, almost level negative table that lasts into the mid-80s. A steady rise then carries the curve to a clear secondary summit between 120 – 130, where it settles into a gentle positive shelf until about 155. A fresh descent carves out another extended hollow centred roughly on 190, after which the signal springs upward once more, attaining a third pronounced peak near 300 before tapering away in small positive ripples.  
Best overall match: class_1

Signal 2  
The record begins with a short, rather flat positive segment that shows small bumps up to index 19, then drops abruptly into its deepest trough at 24 – 28. Instead of rebounding, the series sits in an exceptionally long, almost flat negative terrace (≈ −0.87) that stretches past index 120. A ragged climb finally lifts it to middling crests around 155–170, after which it slides back below zero. Much later the trace rockets to a late, highest peak near 270, and thereafter meanders downward with alternating modest rises and falls, finishing close to the axis. The sequence of features (very long early negative shelf, late global maximum) does not accord well with any of the reference patterns.  
Best overall match: none of the given classes

Signal 3  
A mildly positive start wobbles downward, reaching a sharp negative pocket at index 28. Immediately the curve surges to its first and tallest crest at 38, then glides back through zero into a shallow basin in the 60s that deepens to its absolute minimum near 75. A vigorous rebound builds a high flat top around 90, followed by a gradual oscillatory decline that bottoms again at a negative pocket centred on 123. The signal then rises to a small mid-range hump at 160, slips briefly, and finishes with a strong late-stage climb to a second major peak near 190 before subsiding toward the close.  
Best overall match: class_8

Signal 4  
Starting just below the axis, the curve scales twin early peaks at indices 11 and 14 (the second the higher), then descends almost monotonically to its lowest point at 52. It recovers into a low-amplitude shelf hugging zero from the high-60s through the mid-80s, lifts to a moderate hump that sharpens into a broader positive plateau peaking at index 97, and then slides into a prolonged negative table whose floor sits from roughly 130 to 160. A gradual up-slope follows, culminating in a smaller, late-stage crest near 230, after which the trace weakens and drifts toward zero.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace opens on a low, slightly negative ledge, dips a little farther round index 16, then drives upward in a brisk sweep to its earliest – and highest – crest at about index 21.  From there it plunges to a sharp, broad‐bottomed negative basin whose floor lies near index 40 and settles into a long flat sub-level table that persists through roughly the 90s.  A steady climb carries the curve to a secondary rounded summit centred near index 130, after which it slides into another extended hollow covering the low-170s.  A third, well-marked peak rises near index 230 before the record fades away in a gently noisy descent toward the negative side.  
Best fitting class: class_1  

Signal 2  
After a momentary negative blip the curve jumps into a short positive shelf, touching a first local high near index 19.  It then drops steeply through zero to its deepest early trough around index 27 and settles into an unusually long, almost level negative terrace that stretches from roughly indices 30 to 120.  A gradual, stepped rise follows, forming a broad flat roof centred near index 140.  The signal then slumps again, hitting its overall minimum close to index 201, and finally mounts a fresh rally that produces a later – and slightly larger – crest around index 214 before dying away in small undulations.  
Best fitting class: class_4  (alt.: class_8)  

Signal 3  
The record begins with gentle positive flickers, drifts downward and reaches a pronounced negative nadir at index 28, then rockets up to a first sizeable crest at index 38.  It eases into a mild positive shelf before collapsing into an extended flat trench spanning the mid-70s through the 90s.  A renewed ascent takes the trace to twin heights around indices 96 and 157 (the latter the higher).  After edging back toward the axis it slips into a deep pocket centred near index 186, and ends with a hesitant, ripple-studded recovery.  
Best fitting class: class_3  

Signal 4  
Starting on a small negative shelf, the signal climbs rapidly to an early maximum near index 11, then decays almost monotonically through zero in the 40s and settles on a long, level negative plateau whose centre lies in the 80-100 region.  A broad, almost flat-topped rise peaks between indices 100 and 110, after which a steep decline bottoms out near index 175.  Finally the curve rebounds to a more modest late-stage crest around index 213 before tapering away.  
Best fitting class: class_4

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening on a mildly negative shelf the trace makes a brief extra dip around index 16, then swings upward to its first clear crest near index 21.  Immediately afterwards it plunges into its deepest, very broad trough whose almost level floor stretches from the mid-40 s to about index 90.  A patient climb follows, lifting the record into a wide, gently rounded positive roof that tops out in the low-140 s.  It slides again into a second long hollow centred in the mid-170 s, recovers to a modest shoulder close to index 210, and finally launches a late surge that reaches the global maximum at roughly index 235 before ebbing away with small oscillations.  
(best fit: class_8)

signal 2  
After a brief flat positive opening the curve gives a small bump, then dives smartly to its deepest valley at about index 28.  A rebound lifts it to a middling crest in the low-40 s, but the line soon eases downward into a long choppy descent that settles as an extended negative shelf (around −0.9) lasting through roughly index 120.  Abruptly it rockets upward, hitting its overall peak near index 150, then proceeds in a gradually downward series of smaller swings, finishing slightly below zero.  
(best fit: class_2)

signal 3  
The record begins on a gentle near-zero ledge, sags a little further to a local dip at index 22 and then plunges to its overall minimum at index 28.  From there it climbs steadily through the axis to a first broad positive plateau that crests around index 68.  A sharp collapse carries it into a remarkably flat negative trench spanning the high-70 s into the 90 s.  Fresh ascent brings twin crests at about indices 117 and 149 (the latter fractionally higher), after which the trace eases toward zero before dropping into a deep pocket close to index 185.  The series ends with a hesitant recovery peppered by minor ripples.  
(best fit: class_3)

signal 4  
Beginning with several modest negatives the signal quickly rises onto a moderate positive ledge and attains an early high near index 11.  It then decays almost steadily, crossing the axis in the mid-40 s and sliding to a pronounced negative low at index 52.  A brisk rebound follows, lifting the trace into a broad, fairly flat crown that stretches through the mid-60 s and is capped by a loftier summit about index 106.  Thereafter the curve falls away into a long, level negative terrace that occupies roughly indices 130-175, from which it turns up once more to a smaller late-stage crest a little beyond index 200 before tapering off toward the close.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The record opens just below zero, crests quickly at index 2, slips back through the axis to a first shallow dip at 15-16, then rebounds forcefully to its earliest and highest summit at 21.  From there it slides and crashes into its deepest valley at 41 and settles into a long, almost level negative terrace that stretches through roughly indices 45-95.  A steady climb follows, carrying the trace to a broad mid-range plateau that tops out near index 139.  After a brief easing, the curve sags once more into an extended hollow centred around the low 190s, then turns up again, reaches a secondary crest in the low 230s and finally produces a late, but still smaller, third peak a little before the end before tapering away.  
Best–matching class: class_5  

Signal 2  
The curve starts on a short positive shelf punctuated by twin early bulges (indices 1 and 3), then plunges abruptly through zero to its deepest pocket at 27, ushering in a very long, almost flat negative table that lasts up to about index 130.  A brisk ascent lifts it to a broad, middling ridge peaking close to 160; a second, similarly-sized hump follows in the high 170s before the signal slides back into another sizeable negative stretch that bottoms a little past 200.  In the final quarter it rallies sharply and produces a last, but now smaller, summit near index 260 before drifting off.  
Best–matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
Beginning on a gentle negative shelf, the trace dips a touch further around index 28 (its overall minimum), then sweeps upward in a strong, rapid rise to its earliest and tallest crest at 38.  It eases only slightly, then plunges into a broad, flat negative basin spanning roughly indices 70-90.  A recovery brings it to a secondary peak near 130, after which it relaxes again, touching a deep pocket in the low 170s.  A third marked climb tops out in the low 160s before the series fades away with small, hesitant ripples.  
Best–matching class: class_1  

Signal 4  
The series opens on a mild negative ledge, shoots up to an early local high at index 11, and then decays almost monotonically, crossing the axis in the low 40s and continuing down to its first extended negative terrace centred in the high 50s.  A steady lift follows, producing a fairly flat positive roof around indices 65-75, but this is short-lived; the trace turns down again, bottoms close to index 91 and then rockets to its global maximum at 103.  From that crest it slides into a still deeper, wide hollow that reaches its floor (≈ –1.6) in the mid-150s before staging a late-cycle recovery.  That rebound manages a modest crest near 220, after which the signal drifts quietly downward.  
Best–matching class: class_7 (class 2 is a distant alternative)
