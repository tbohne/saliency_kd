 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1 – description  
The trace opens on a mild negative shelf a little below −1, slides to a slightly deeper nick at index 18, then sweeps upward through the axis.  It builds first to a modest crest at index 55 and, still rising, to its tallest early summit at index 74.  From there it dives into a long, fairly flat trench of gentle negatives that stretches through the high-80s and low-90s.  A renewed climb leads to two distinct crests at indices 120 and 162 (the latter the higher), after which the curve eases back.  It falls to its broadest and deepest hollow around index 210, then mounts a late, hesitant rebound peaking just past index 220 before fading away.  
Best-matching class: class_3

signal 2 – description  
Following a short, low positive ledge, the series plunges to an early deep minimum at index 17, then rockets up to a tall peak at index 57.  It relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 90, and sinks still further to its overall floor at about index 135.  A brisk ascent carries it to its global maximum close to index 150; thereafter it declines into the negative in the mid-170s, only to stage a fresh climb that tops out near index 215 before subsiding toward the axis.  
Best-matching class: class_7  (indices and sequencing of the twin deep troughs, the maxima at ≈57 and ≈150, and the late rebound fit this template most closely)

signal 3 – description  
Starting a touch below zero, the curve rises through paired early peaks at indices 3 and 25 (the second higher), then tumbles to its deepest valley at index 79.  It recovers into a long, low-amplitude shelf that straddles the axis from roughly indices 90–115, lifts to a moderate hump around index 125 and a broader plateau centred in the mid-140s, and slides again into a protracted negative table whose floor lies in the high 170s.  Finally it mounts a gradual comeback that reaches its overall summit at about index 220 before tapering away.  
Best-matching class: class_5

signal 4 – description  
The record begins just above zero but drops steeply into an early trough at index 10, pokes up to a small bump at index 15, and then tracks sideways before embarking on a long ascent crowned by a strong peak at index 56.  It sags into an extended shallow terrace of small negatives between roughly indices 100–120, plunges to its deepest pocket at index 121, and powers upward again to its highest crest near index 160.  A fresh fall carries it back into negative territory around index 175; this is followed by a late rally that reaches a secondary summit close to index 200 before the trace weakens once more.  Although it shares some broad features with several catalogued shapes, the ordering and relative amplitudes depart too far from any single prototype, so no confident class assignment is possible.  
Best-matching class: none (does not correspond closely to any of the eight reference classes)

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Beginning on a low, gently noisy negative shelf, the trace makes a slightly deeper dip about index 18, then climbs steadily through the axis to reach its earliest – and tallest – crest near index 56.  From that summit it plunges into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-80s, rises again to a secondary peak around index 124, slides into another shallow hollow that spans roughly indices 150-165, then mounts a third marked peak close to index 195 before fading away in a slow, irregular descent that settles back on the negative side.  
→ best match: class_1  

signal 2  
After a brief flat positive opening the curve forms a modest bump, dives smartly to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds to a middling crest in the high-30s, pauses, then surges higher to a pronounced peak round index 56.  It slips into a choppy descent whose floor lies just after index 90, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum near index 144, and thereafter undulates downward in successively smaller swings, ending a shade below zero.  
→ best match: class_2  

signal 3  
The record opens on a tiny positive blip, drops quickly into a negative pocket that bottoms near index 31, then levels into an extended shallow trench through the 40s-60s.  A steady climb leads to a broad positive terrace between about indices 90 and 120, carrying twin crests near 111 and 120 (the latter a little higher).  From there it falls away into a deep bowl whose lowest point sits in the mid-160s, rallies in a vigorous rise that tops out about index 178, and finally drifts downward again with minor ripples, closing on the negative side.  
→ best match: class_4 (alternative fit could be class_3 but the sequence of terraces and late rebound matches class_4 slightly better)

signal 4  
Starting with a very short, low positive ledge the series plunges to an early minimum around index 10, recovers briefly, then rockets to a tall peak near index 55.  It eases back, swinging negative again with a shallow valley near index 98 and a deeper floor at about index 129, before mounting a brisk ascent that produces the global maximum close to index 178.  The curve then declines into lightly negative territory, only to stage a fresh climb that peaks a bit above index 205, after which it subsides toward the end.  
→ best match: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Beginning on a broad, gently noisy negative shelf, the trace dips a little further at about index 18-20, then swings upward, crossing the axis and reaching an earliest high crest near index 55 before surging a bit higher to its first and tallest peak at index 74.  From there it plunges into a wide hollow centred in the mid-80s, recovers in a steady climb to a secondary summit around index 142, slides into a shallow trough that stretches through the mid-160s to the high-170s, then mounts a third distinct crest at index 202.  After that the signal fades away in a gradually descending, slightly rippled run that ends back on the negative side.  
(best match: class_1)

signal 2  
After a short, low-level positive preamble the curve makes a modest bump, then drops abruptly to its deepest trough at index 17.  It rebounds to a middling crest in the low-40s, slips back, and rises more forcefully to a higher peak near index 59.  A choppy descent follows, bottoming just after index 100, whereupon the trace rockets upward to its overall maximum close to index 140.  From that summit it undulates downward in progressively smaller swings and finishes slightly below zero.  
(best match: class_2)

signal 3  
The record opens just above the axis, dips negative almost immediately, then vaults to a sizable early summit at index 25.  It slides back through zero into a modest basin that deepens to its first serious floor around index 31, recovers to a flat positive table that tops out in the high-80s, and then dives to its deepest pocket near index 79.  A brisk climb follows, building a high plateau whose crown sits between indices 110 and 120, after which the trace wavers downward into an extended negative shelf that bottoms in the mid-160s.  Finally it launches a powerful late-stage ascent that reaches the global maximum near index 191 before tapering away in an undulating decline.  
(best match: class_8 – alternate but less consistent: class_7)

signal 4  
Beginning with a faint positive blip, the series plunges to a sharp early minimum around index 10, then rebounds in a long steady rise that crests strongly at index 56.  It relaxes into a drawn-out mid-level ledge lasting to roughly index 100, sinks into an extensive negative terrace whose deepest point lies near index 126, and then mounts a brisk ascent to its global maximum close to index 161.  The curve drops again, slipping below the axis in the vicinity of 190, and finally stages a fresh but smaller rally that peaks just after index 205 before subsiding toward the end.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening on a low, gently undulating negative shelf, the trace makes a slightly deeper dip at index 18, then sweeps upward through the axis to reach its first and tallest crest at index 74. From there it plunges into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-80s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 144, glides down into another subdued hollow spanning roughly indices 170-180, then mounts a third pronounced peak at index 206 before ebbing away in a lightly noisy descent that ends on the negative side.  
Best–matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
After a brief flat positive outset the curve forms a modest bump, dives smartly to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds to a mid-level crest near index 38, eases, then surges higher to a pronounced peak around index 58. It slides off in a choppy decline that bottoms just before index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward in progressively smaller swings, finishing a little below zero.  
Best–matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
The record begins on a mild near-zero ledge, slips briefly negative, and rises sharply to an early crest at index 3, is followed by a higher twin crest at index 25, then collapses to a deep pocket at index 31. It hovers in a shallow, almost level trench until the high-70s, climbs to a first positive plateau topping out just above index 100, and continues upward to paired crests at indices 108 and 140 (the latter higher). After easing back toward the axis it drops into a pronounced hollow centred near index 185, and closes with a hesitant, rippling recovery that never quite regains the positive side.  
Best–matching class: class_3 (class_4 is a distant alternative)  

signal 4  
Starting with a tiny positive shelf, the series tumbles to a sharp minimum at index 10, then rockets to a tall peak at index 55. It relaxes, swings negative again to a trough close to index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 135, and mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 176. The trace then declines once more into firm negativity near index 205 before staging a fresh climb that peaks close to index 234, after which it subsides toward the close.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace begins on an extended shallow negative shelf that hovers just below –1 for the first dozen-plus samples.  It then dips a little farther to its deepest early pocket at about index 18 before turning upward.  From there the curve rises steadily, cresting first near index 56 and then reaching its tallest early summit about index 75.  Immediately afterwards it plunges into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-80s, touches its lowest later value there, and then settles into a long, almost level sub-zero terrace running through roughly indices 95-165.  A brief upward flicker produces a modest secondary bump around index 126, after which the plateau resumes.  Near index 206 the series mounts a final pronounced peak – the last clear high point – and then ebbs away in a gently noisy descent that ends slightly below the axis.  

Best-matching class: class_1  

------------------------------------------------------------  
Signal 2  
The curve opens on a short, low-amplitude positive ledge, then plunges sharply to its overall minimum at about index 17.  A brisk rebound carries it to a strong crest in the high 50s, after which it wavers, dipping back below zero in the 70s and sinking into an extended negative table whose secondary floor lies close to index 124.  From there the record climbs in a long, stepped advance that builds into a broad ridge spanning roughly indices 130-140 – the global maximum occurring in that interval.  Thereafter the line drifts gradually downward in smaller, mostly positive ripples and comes to rest only a little above the axis.  

Best-matching class: class_6  

------------------------------------------------------------  
Signal 3  
The record starts almost at the axis, slips into a brief dip at index 1, and then shoots up to an early crest at 3 and a still higher twin peak at 25.  A rapid fall follows, bottoming in the deepest trough of the whole trace near index 31.  What follows is a flat sub-zero shelf lasting into the low 60s, after which the signal rises to a modest positive plateau extending through the 80s and early 90s and topping out near index 103.  A renewed slide carries the trace down into a long, deep pocket whose floor sits around indices 150-160.  From that hollow the curve surges sharply to its overall maximum just past index 170, then embarks on a steady, uneven decline that takes it back below zero to another trough in the 210s.  The series closes in a subdued, slightly negative drift punctuated by small ripples.  

No existing class matches this overall pattern closely; the sequence of extremes and their positions deviate markedly from every reference class.  

Best-matching class: (no adequate match)  

------------------------------------------------------------  
Signal 4  
A brief, low positive opening is followed by a swift slide to a local minimum around index 10.  The trace then rockets upward to its first significant crest near index 54.  After a moderate relaxation it crosses the axis and settles into an extended shallow negative terrace that occupies roughly indices 110-140.  This gives way to a steep descent that bottoms in the deepest valley of the run at about index 146.  A vigorous rebound ensues, driving the signal to its global summit near index 194.  The line then slumps again, dipping into a secondary hollow just after index 210, before mounting a late-stage recovery that peaks close to index 238 and finally tails off.  

Best-matching class: class_7 (the overall sequence of an early plunge, an early peak, a deeper mid-course trough, a still higher main peak, another dip and a final rebound most closely echoes class 7, though the timings are slightly later throughout).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1 – description  
The trace opens on a gently negative shelf a little below –1.0.  A brief extra dip takes it to its first minimum (about –1.44 at index 18).  From there it sweeps upward, edging through the axis and topping out in a first conspicuous crest at index 57 (≈1.1) and, a few samples later, in a still higher summit near index 76 (≈1.5).  It then plunges into a broad negative basin whose floor lies at index 88.  A long, low-amplitude table hugging the zero line extends from the low-90s to about 130.  The curve next lifts to a middling hump (≈1.2) around index 135, slides away into another shallow hollow centred in the high-160s, sinks still farther to a secondary floor at index 197, and vaults sharply to its overall maximum (≈1.6) at index 207.  After that last strong peak it oscillates downward, crossing a modest spur near index 244, and finally fades away on the negative side.  
best-matching class: class_5  

signal 2 – description  
A short flat positive porch (≈0.9) is followed by a headlong dive to the record’s deepest trough at index 17 (≈–1.6).  The signal rebounds to a mild crest around index 38, wavers near the axis, then surges decisively to a tall peak at index 61 (≈1.7).  A choppy descent takes it into the red again, bottoming just beyond index 110.  Suddenly it rockets upward, reaching its global maximum (≈1.9) at index 129.  From that high point the series undulates downward: a negative pocket touches –1.7 near index 171, a lesser rebound (≈1.7) appears in the high-180s, and progressively smaller swings carry the trace toward a finish a shade below zero.  
best-matching class: class_2   (class_7 is a faint secondary possibility)

signal 3 – description  
The record starts close to the axis, dips lightly to a small negative pocket at index 1, then leaps to an early crest at index 3 (≈1.3).  After a brief lull it rises higher still, posting a first substantial summit (≈1.6) at index 25, before collapsing into its overall minimum (≈–1.4) at index 31.  A shallow negative trench persists into the low-60s.  Climbing steadily, the trace crosses zero and settles into a long modestly positive shelf between roughly indices 90 and 115, from which it lifts to a mid-range peak (≈1.4) about index 120.  It then eases back, drops into another deep pocket centred near index 165 (≈–1.3), and finally mounts a late powerful advance that culminates in a second major peak (≈1.7) at index 198.  Thereafter it sags away in a hesitant, noisy decline toward the negative side.  
best-matching class: class_8   (no other class follows the two-major-peaks pattern as closely)

signal 4 – description  
Beginning with a brief shallow positive shelf, the series collapses to an early minimum around index 10 (≈–1.1), then rockets to a tall peak at index 56 (≈1.9).  It relaxes through a gentle positive slope and stalls on a flat ledge near 0.3 that stretches into the 90s.  A renewed fall drives the curve negative again, touching a trough near index 104 and plunging to its deepest point (≈–1.8) at index 127.  A brisk ascent follows, carrying the trace to its global maximum (≈2.0) around index 169.  A sharp drop returns it below zero in the mid-170s, but a fresh rally peaks close to index 224 (≈1.9) before the signal finally subsides.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The record sets off on a gently sloping negative shelf that holds through the mid-40s, dips a shade deeper at index 18, then turns smartly upward to break the axis and crest first at index 54 and again—slightly higher—at index 73. From that early high it plunges into a broad, long-lived negative basin whose floor lies near indices 82-88. A steady climb lifts the trace to a second pronounced summit centred about index 143, after which it slides into an extended flat hollow stretching roughly from 170 to 185. Out of this depression it mounts a third marked peak at index 208 and then fades away in a gently noisy decline that settles back below zero.  
→ best matches class_1  

signal 2  
A short positive preamble ends in a modest hill near index 1 before the curve dives to its deepest trough at index 17. It rebounds to a middling crest around index 38, eases, then surges higher to a strong peak at index 59. A choppy descent bottoms just after the century mark, and the signal suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 147. Thereafter it undulates downward in progressively smaller swings, coming to rest a little below the axis.  
→ best matches class_2  

signal 3  
The trace begins close to the axis, slips briefly negative at index 1, then leaps to an early crest at index 3 and an even taller one at index 25. It collapses into its deepest pit at index 31 and settles into a long, flat trench of almost uniform depth that stretches into the low-70s. A measured rise carries it to a gentle positive shelf through the 100s and on to twin crests at indices 111 and 166 (the latter higher). From there it eases back toward zero, falls into a deep pocket centred near index 200, and finishes with a hesitant, ripple-studded recovery.  
→ best matches class_3  

signal 4  
The series opens on a slight positive ledge, quickly plunges to an early minimum at index 10, and rockets to a tall peak at index 55. After relaxing it slides negative, finding a trough near index 100 and its absolute floor at index 126. A brisk ascent follows, culminating in the global maximum around index 160. The trace then declines into negative ground in the mid-180s, but rallies once more, reaching a final crest close to index 240 before subsiding toward the end.  
→ best matches class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace sets out on a modestly negative shelf, makes a slightly sharper dip at index 18, then swings upward to a first clear crest at index 55 and a still higher early apex at index 74.  From there it plunges into a broad negative basin whose floor lies near index 86, climbs out into an extended, almost level-with-zero shelf that stretches through the 90s and up to about index 140, rises again to a secondary summit around index 143, slips into another shallow hollow centred on indices 170-180, drops more decisively to a deeper pocket at index 191, and finally mounts a third strong peak at index 200 before subsiding in a gently rippling decline that ends on the negative side.  
Best match: class_1  

Signal 2  
After a brief low-amplitude positive ledge the series tumbles to its first and deepest trough at index 17, rockets upward to a tall crest at index 61, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 92 and an even lower pocket at index 133, then launches a brisk ascent that produces the global maximum around index 147.  It falls back into negative territory just after index 170, makes a fresh recovery that tops out near index 188 and again around index 241, and finally wanes toward zero.  
Best match: class_7  

Signal 3  
Beginning very near the axis, the record slips to a small negative dip at index 1, leaps to a modest crest at index 3 and a higher early peak at index 25, then collapses to a pronounced trough at index 31.  It hovers in a shallow negative trench through the 50s-60s, climbs steadily into a long positive shelf that spans roughly indices 90-110, bumps up to a hump at about index 118, drifts, and then slides into an extended descent that bottoms in a wide negative pocket centred on indices 155-170.  A vigorous late-stage surge follows, delivering the overall maximum near index 192, after which the curve declines in a choppy run that ends well below the axis.  
Best match: class_8  

Signal 4  
The signal opens with a tiny positive blip and promptly drops to an early minimum at index 10, rebounds through a modest rise at index 15 and a much stronger climb that reaches a prominent crest at index 55.  It then decays, crossing zero and settling into a long, nearly level negative terrace from roughly indices 100-120 (deepest at indices 122 and 129).  A broad, highest summit is attained around index 163, after which the trace slides steeply into another negative basin centred near index 184.  Finally it mounts a renewed advance that culminates in a late secondary peak at index 222 before easing away.  
Best match: class_7  (class_4 is a possible but weaker alternative)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace opens on a mildly negative platform a little below –0.6, slips to a slightly deeper notch at index 18, then swings steadily upward through the axis, cresting first around index 56 and again—higher—near index 75.  From there it dives into a broad hollow whose floor (≈ –1.2) sits in the mid-80s, rounds out into an almost level trench that stretches through roughly indices 90–160, pokes up only briefly to a small mid-height hump in the low-120s, and drops once more to a second distinct dip centred near index 176.  A vigorous late climb sends the curve to a third marked peak (its overall maximum, ≈ 1.6) at about index 185; a gentle ridge near 210 follows before the signal subsides in noisy undulations and finishes a shade below the zero line.  
Best-matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
After a short, slightly positive prelude the curve forms a modest rise, plunges to its deepest valley close to index 17, rebounds to a middling crest in the low-40s, hesitates, then thrusts higher to a stronger peak around index 60.  It slides away in a choppy descent that bottoms just past index 80, suddenly rockets upward to its absolute maximum (≈ 1.9) near index 134, and thereafter works gradually downward in smaller and smaller swings, ending a touch on the negative side.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
A tiny positive blip is followed immediately by an early dip (index 1), then by a fast rise to a sharp crest at index 3.  The record holds a low-amplitude positive shelf (≈ 0.47) through the mid-teens, leaps to a taller summit at index 25, and collapses to its overall minimum in the low-30s.  It then enters an extended, nearly flat negative trench (≈ –0.2) that persists to about index 70 before climbing across zero into a broad upper plateau between roughly indices 115 and 155, crowned by peaks near 140-150 (the highest touching ≈ 1.7).  From that high ground the trace slides away in an uneven but largely steady decline, crossing the axis again in the 170s, sinking to another deep pocket around index 215, and closing still below zero with only a hesitant partial recovery.  
Best-matching class: (no convincing match – none of the reference patterns lines up sufficiently)  

signal 4  
The series starts with a fleeting positive tick, plunges to an early trough around index 10, then fires up to a tall crest near index 55.  It eases back, crossing the axis close to index 100 and settling into a shallow negative ledge whose lowest point (≈ –1.8) lies in the high-120s.  A brisk ascent follows, driving the curve to its global summit (≈ 2.0) at about index 165; the signal then falls steeply to another negative valley near index 194 before staging one last climb to a secondary high close to index 219, after which it tails off.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1 – description  
The trace opens on a shallow negative shelf a little below –0.6, makes a sharper dip to its first local minimum at index 18, then climbs steadily through the axis to its earliest and highest crest about index 74.  From there it plunges into a wide negative trough whose floor lies in the mid-80 s, rises again to a secondary summit near index 141, slips into a brief hollow centred around indices 170-180, mounts a third marked peak at index 201, and finally wanders downward in uneven ripples, dropping to a late deep pocket in the mid-250 s before a modest last-moment uptick.  
best matching class: class_1  

signal 2 – description  
After a short flat positive beginning the curve produces a small bump in the mid-50 s, dives to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, then surges higher to a strong peak close to index 59.  It slips into a choppy decline that bottoms a little past index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 142, and thereafter undulates downward with progressively smaller swings, ending very close to the zero line.  
best matching class: class_2  

signal 3 – description  
The record starts on a mild positive ledge, sinks briefly at index 1, then rises to an early crest at index 3.  After hovering on a low-amplitude positive plateau it lifts again to a higher peak near index 25, collapses into an extended flat trench from the mid-30 s through the 60 s, climbs back to a first positive shelf topping out just after index 70, falls sharply to a negative pocket around index 86, then ascends to twin crests near indices 117 and 150 (the latter the taller).  From there it eases toward zero, plunges to a broad deep basin centred in the high-180 s, and finishes with a hesitant recovery punctuated by small ripples.  
best matching class: class_3  

signal 4 – description  
Beginning with a brief small positive blip, the series quickly drops to a deep minimum at index 10, then races up to a tall peak at index 54.  It relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 100, falls still further to its lowest point at index 128, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into negative territory in the 170-190 range, and ends with a fresh climb that tops out near index 221 before subsiding toward the close.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Beginning on a mildly negative shelf, the trace sinks a little further to its first and deepest dip about index 18, then sweeps sharply upward through the axis and reaches its earliest and tallest crest at index 57.  It plunges into a broad negative basin centred in the high-80s, climbs again to a secondary summit near index 145, eases back into a shallow hollow round indices 170-178, then mounts a third marked peak close to index 194 before meandering away in a gently noisy decline that finishes a little below zero.  
best-matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
After a short flat positive opening the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds to a middling crest in the low-40s/60s, eases back, then surges higher to a peak near index 59.  From there it slides in a choppy descent that bottoms just past index 100, suddenly rockets to its global maximum around index 122, and thereafter undulates downward with ever-smaller swings, ending slightly on the negative side.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
The record starts close to the axis, makes a quick dip then leaps to a sizeable crest at index 3 and a still higher one at index 25.  It slides back, plunges to its deepest pocket in the high-70s, surges into a broad high plateau topping out near index 90, declines while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred in the 130s-140s, rises to a small mid-range hump about index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak a little before index 190 before tapering toward the end.  
best-matching class: class_8  

signal 4  
Starting with a tiny positive ledge the series quickly collapses to an early floor at index 10, rockets to a tall peak near index 54, relaxes, swings negative into a trough around index 100 and a still deeper low just after 120, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum roughly at index 183, declines once more into the negative near index 210, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 230 before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The record opens on a broad, mildly negative shelf, then slips to a sharper early low around index 18.  From there it sweeps upward to its first clear crest near index 55, dips momentarily below the axis in the low-60s, and immediately heaves higher to a taller summit about index 74.  A long, rather flat negative basin centred in the mid-80s follows.  After drifting close to zero through a subdued stretch that lasts into the 130s, the trace climbs again to a secondary peak near index 143, slides into another hollow between roughly indices 170 and 180, then rallies sharply to a third marked crest at index 203 before petering out in a gently noisy decline on the negative side.

signal 2  
After a short positive ledge the curve raises a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds smartly to a middling ridge around index 38, eases back, then surges higher to a peak close to index 57.  It slips away in a choppy fall that bottoms just after index 90, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum near index 134, and thereafter undulates downward in ever-smaller swings, finishing a little below zero.  
⇢ best match: class_2  

signal 3  
Beginning on a gentle negative shelf the series nods through a minor dip, then accelerates to a pronounced early crest at index 25.  It plunges through zero to its deepest valley around index 31, settles into an extended flat trench lasting into the high-60s, and then climbs across the axis into a broad positive table whose crown sits in the low-90s.  After wavering it sinks to a fresh pocket near index 164, climbs to a modest hump in the 170s, drops briefly once more, and finally mounts a strong late-stage ascent that reaches its global maximum about index 190 before sliding away in a hesitant decline.

signal 4  
The trace starts with a tiny positive plateau, plunges to an early minimum near index 10, then rockets to a tall peak at index 56.  It relaxes and swings negative, settling into a shallow trough centred in the high-80s, falls still farther to its lowest point around index 123, mounts a brisk ascent that crests modestly near index 150, slips again, and finally surges to its global maximum roughly at index 181.  From there it declines into the negative in the low-200s and manages one more small late-stage rise peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace opens on a fairly flat negative shelf a little below –1, pokes still lower to its first and deepest jab about index 18, then climbs steadily through the axis to a first rather modest crest roughly at index 55.  It slips back under zero in the low-60 s, only to drive higher to a sharper summit near index 74.  From there it plunges into a broad, almost level trench that occupies much of the 90 s and early-120 s.  A renewed rise delivers a mid-range hump in the mid-130 s, after which the signal drops away to its widest and lowest pocket centred in the low-180 s.  It rebounds briskly to its overall maximum around index 192, then meanders downward in uneven swings, touching another trough in the 220 s and ending with a faint, noisy tail just below the axis.  
Best match: class_3 (alternative, though less precise: class_5)

signal 2  
Following a brief flat positive opening the curve makes a small fore-bump and then dives to its deepest trough at about index 17.  It rebounds to a middling crest in the low-50 s, eases back a little, and surges higher to a stronger peak just past index 60.  A jagged descent ensues, bottoming shortly after index 90; from there the series rockets to its global maximum close to index 133.  Thereafter it undulates downward in progressively smaller swings and comes to rest a touch below zero.  
Best match: class_2

signal 3  
A tiny initial uptick is instantly reversed as the record slips to a quick dip at index 1, then leaps to an early high around index 3.  The line drifts downward and reaches its deepest valley at index 31, after which it hugs the negative side until it crosses the axis again in the low-70 s.  It spreads into a long low positive mesa that lasts to about index 120, sags once more to a negative pocket whose floor lies in the mid-150 s, and finally embarks on a stepped ascent that achieves the loftiest plateau (topping out near index 169).  A gentle, slightly noisy decline follows, carrying the signal back toward and just beneath zero by the finish.  
Best match: class_8 (alternative: class_7)

signal 4  
The series starts with a slight positive blip before tumbling to a sharp early trough near index 10.  It then climbs smartly to a tall crest about index 56, retreats by stages into a long mild positive shelf that spans the late-60 s through the 90 s, and slides beneath the axis to settle on a broad negative terrace whose deepest point (about –1.8) comes near index 128.  After a brief pause the trace mounts a vigorous climb that reaches its overall peak close to index 175.  A brisk fall follows, carrying the curve back below zero; smaller, choppy swings mark the closing segment, which ends a little on the negative side.  
Best match: class_7 (possible but weaker alternative: class_1)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace opens on a low, almost level negative shelf, then slips slightly lower to its first local floor near index 18.  From there it rises in a steady arc that crests strongly – and for the whole record most sharply – at about index 74.  A sharp fall follows, bottoming in a broad, gently undulating negative basin that occupies the mid-80s through the early-120s.  The curve then lifts to a secondary summit close to index 123, slides back into another shallow negative table that stretches to the mid-160s, drops briefly to a deeper pocket around index 166, and springs up to a third marked peak near index 180.  After that it wavers downward, briefly punching down to a late dip in the 230s before fading with small positive/negative ripples toward the end.  
Best overall match: class_1  

signal 2  
A short positive ledge at the outset carries a modest bump during the first few samples, after which the series dives abruptly to its global minimum at index 17.  It rebounds to a medium-sized crest around index 40, relents, then drives higher to a pronounced peak close to index 60.  A ragged slide ensues, reaching a secondary trough just after index 100, followed by an explosive climb to the absolute maximum near index 149.  From there the record undulates downward in ever-smaller swings, finishing only slightly above the axis.  
Best overall match: class_2  

signal 3  
The record begins on a mild negative ledge, dips a little further at index 1, and immediately vaults to paired early highs at indices 3 and 25 (the latter the taller).  It then collapses into an extended flat trench of roughly constant depth from the low-40s through the mid-60s.  Climbing steadily, it reaches a broad positive shelf spanning roughly indices 85-110, eases, and gathers itself for fresh advances that form successive crests around indices 116 and 192 (the later one higher).  After this the curve relaxes, slipping below zero near index 210, and descends into a protracted, moderately deep negative run that persists to the close, punctuated only by small ripples.  
Best overall match: class_8  

signal 4  
A tiny positive start is followed immediately by a sharp plunge to a first deep minimum at index 10.  The signal then rockets upward, topping out in a tall peak near index 56, and drifts downward through zero into a choppy negative trough centred on the mid-90s, sinking still lower to its deepest valley around index 123.  A brisk ascent next carries the trace to its global maximum about index 167, after which it slides steeply into another negative pocket in the mid-190s.  Finally it rebounds once more, achieving a last significant crest close to index 230 before subsiding in a gentle decline.  
Best overall match: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record starts on a broad, rather flat negative shelf a little below –0.6.  It slides a shade deeper to a local floor at index 18 (≈ –1.44), then embarks on a steady climb that crests sharply and earliest at index 74 (≈ 1.50), the highest height reached.  From there it dives into an ample, gently curved negative basin whose centre lies in the mid-80 s (minimum about –1.24).  A fresh rise lifts the trace to a secondary summit around index 140 (≈ 1.24), after which it drifts down into a long, shallow hollow extending through the 150 s and 160 s.  A third marked peak stands out at index 212 (≈ 1.57).  Beyond that point the waveform ebbs away in small noisy ripples, settling gradually back on the negative side.  
Best matching class: class_1  

Signal 2  
After a brief positive ledge the curve makes a modest hump, then plunges to its deepest trough at index 17 (≈ –1.58).  It rebounds to a middling crest a little above zero in the low-40 s, slackens only briefly and surges higher to a peak near index 59 (≈ 1.73).  A choppy descent follows and bottoms just past index 100 (≈ –1.17).  Suddenly the trace rockets to its overall maximum at index 140 (≈ 1.90).  From that apogee it undulates downward in progressively smaller swings, finishing a touch below the axis.  
Best matching class: class_2  

Signal 3  
The series opens just under the axis, arches to a first peak at index 3 (≈ 1.34) and to a still higher sister crest at index 25 (≈ 1.56).  It then tumbles to its deepest valley at index 31 (≈ –1.40).  A long, low-amplitude shelf that straddles zero stretches from roughly index 40 to about 110.  The trace pushes up again to a moderate hump near index 120 (≈ 1.39) and rolls into a broader, flatter positive table centred on the low-130 s.  Next it slides into a prolonged negative plateau whose floor lies in the mid-160 s (≈ –1.34).  Ultimately the waveform stages a steady late-stage comeback that tops out near index 200 (≈ 1.70) before petering out in a mild decline.  
Best matching class: class_5  

Signal 4  
A tiny positive blip at the start is followed by a swift collapse to an early minimum at index 10 (≈ –1.07).  The trace then rockets to a tall peak at index 55 (≈ 1.94).  It relaxes and swings negative again with a trough near index 98, plunges still deeper to its absolute floor at index 119 (≈ –1.77), and mounts a vigorous ascent that culminates in the global maximum around index 158 (≈ 2.05).  Another decline carries the signal below zero close to index 175, after which a fresh climb peaks near index 230 (~0.48) before the final fade.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Opening on a low, rather flat negative shelf, the trace sags a little deeper to a first local floor about index 18, then sweeps upward to its earliest and highest crest near index 55.  From there it plunges into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-80s, climbs again to a clear secondary summit around index 143, drifts down into an extended hollow spanning roughly indices 171-178, then mounts a third, smaller but still distinct peak close to index 201 before fading away in a gently noisy descent that ends on the negative side.  
→ best matches class_1  

signal 2  
After a brief low-amplitude positive perch the curve makes a modest bump, dives sharply to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds to a middling crest near the upper 30s, eases back, then surges higher to a strong peak at index 59.  It slips into a choppy downward run that bottoms just past index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 144, and thereafter undulates downward with progressively smaller swings, coming to rest only a touch below the axis.  
→ best matches class_2  

signal 3  
The record begins on a mild negative ledge, dips a shade further in the low 30s, then rises steadily through zero into a first positive table that tops out near indices 85-90.  It collapses into an extended, almost level trench from the high-70s through the mid-80s, climbs once more to twin crests at about indices 101 and 174 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, sinks into a deep pocket around index 196, and finishes with a hesitant, ripple-studded recovery.  
→ best matches class_3  

signal 4  
Starting with a tiny positive tick, the series quickly collapses to a sharp minimum at index 10, then rockets to a tall peak at index 55.  After relaxing, it turns negative again with a trough near index 101 and falls still farther to its absolute low at index 122.  A brisk ascent follows, culminating in the global maximum around index 162; the trace then declines once more into the negative near index 183, before mounting a fresh late-stage climb that peaks close to index 221 and finally subsides.  
→ best matches class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Description: The trace opens on a lightly negative shelf, slips to a deeper dip around index 18, then climbs in a steady sweep to a first positive crest near index 56. It relaxes briefly, surges higher to a still-taller peak about index 74, and plunges into its broadest negative trough centred in the mid-80s. From there it settles into an extended shallow trench that hovers just below the axis through the 90s and early 120s, after which it rises to successive crests at indices 132 and 160 (the latter the higher). A fresh sag follows, bottoming sharply near index 220, and the record ends with a hesitant recovery marked by small ripples.  
Best-fitting class: class_3  

signal 2  
Description: After a short positive prelude and minor bump the curve dives steeply, reaching its deepest minimum at index 17. It rebounds to a middling rise around the low-40s and then accelerates to a strong peak close to index 60. A choppy decline bottoms just after index 100, whereupon the series bursts upward to its global maximum near index 140. Thereafter it undulates downward in ever-smaller swings and closes a shade below zero.  
Best-fitting class: class_2  

signal 3  
Description: The record begins almost flat, tips into a small dip at index 1, and vaults to an early peak at index 3, followed by a still-higher crest at index 26. It then plunges to its deepest basin around index 31 before creeping upward into a long positive table spanning roughly indices 70-110. A renewed slide carves a negative pocket centred in the high-140s; this is succeeded by a modest hump near index 162, a brief setback, and a powerful late climb that produces the overall summit about index 192. The signal fades thereafter in a gently oscillatory descent through the axis into the negative.  
Best-fitting class: class_8 (class_5 is a far-second alternative)  

signal 4  
Description: Starting with a slight positive shelf the series drops into a deep minimum at index 10, then rockets to a tall crest around index 55. It eases back and crosses below zero, forming a secondary trough in the neighbourhood of index 100, and sinks further to its absolute low near index 122. A vigorous ascent culminates in the global maximum at index 162, after which the curve dips negative again in the mid-170s and, finally, mounts a late-stage rise peaking close to index 218 before tapering away.  
Best-fitting class: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace opens on a shallow, slightly noisy negative shelf a little below the axis.  It nudges still lower to a local floor at index 18, then swings upward in a steady arc that crests first near index 56 and again (a shade higher) at index 74.  Immediately afterward it drops smartly through zero into a broad, gently curved negative basin whose deepest point sits in the mid-80s.  From there it climbs to a secondary summit around index 138, slips into a long, almost level hollow that stretches through the low 170s, and mounts a third clear-cut peak near index 199 before fading away in a wavering decline that ends back on the negative side.  
Best matching class: class_1  

Signal 2  
A brief flat positive beginning ends in a modest bump, after which the curve plunges to its overall minimum at index 17.  It rebounds to a middling crest close to index 40, relaxes for a moment and then drives higher to a stronger peak at index 61.  A choppy descent follows, bottoming in the low 80s, and is succeeded by a sudden, almost vertical surge that carries the signal to its global maximum at index 150.  Thereafter the record undulates downward in progressively smaller swings, finishing a little below zero.  
Best matching class: class_2  

Signal 3  
Starting just under the axis, the series rises quickly to an early bump at index 3 and a still taller crest at index 25.  It then tumbles into a sharp, deep trough centred on index 31, recovers only weakly and idles in a near-flat trench through the 40s and 60s.  A steady climb lifts it into a broad, low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 88 and 110, followed by a moderate hump about index 112 and a slightly higher shoulder in the mid-130s.  The trace then slides into an extended negative table whose floor lies in the 150s, before staging a gradual comeback that culminates in a pronounced late-stage peak at index 189.  After that summit it declines again toward the negative.  
Best matching class: class_5  (class 8 would be a distant second choice)

Signal 4  
The record begins with a small positive ledge and a first, modest crest at index 15, sinks back through zero, then climbs in stages to a broad, prominent summit at index 55.  From that early high it decays almost monotonically, crossing the axis in the mid-90s and settling into a long, flat negative terrace that occupies the region around indices 100–120.  A fresh ascent carries the signal into a wide, nearly level top centred near index 152, after which it slips into a steep fall that bottoms close to index 190.  Finally the curve rebounds to a smaller, late crest a little past index 210 before easing down once more.  
Best matching class: class_4

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
Opening on a shallow, almost level negative shelf a little below –0.6, the trace briefly sinks to a sharper pit at index 18, then arcs upward in a ragged climb that produces a first solid crest near index 55 and its tallest early summit at index 74.  From there it dives head-first into a broad negative basin whose floor sits in the mid-80s, works its way onto a long, low-amplitude ledge just under the axis that stretches through the 110s, and lifts again to a secondary peak about index 125.  Sliding away once more, it drops into another extended hollow spanning roughly 171-178, vaults to a third marked peak at index 184, throws up a smaller after-hump near index 211, and finally dwindles in a gently noisy fall that bottoms in the low-220s before edging back toward neutral.  
Best overall fit: class_1  

Signal 2  
The curve begins with a brief flat positive perch, raises a modest bump, then plunges to its deepest trough at index 17.  A quick rebound carries it to a middling crest around index 40, and a stronger surge tops out near index 60.  From that height it slips into a choppy descent whose lowest point comes just after index 100, whereupon it rockets upward to its global maximum at index 134.  Thereafter it undulates downward in steadily diminishing swings, ending a touch either side of the zero line.  
Best overall fit: class_2  

Signal 3  
Starting close to the axis, the series dips lightly at index 1, vaults to an early spike at index 3, and settles into a low positive shelf that persists through the teens.  It then collapses into its broadest, deepest trench centred on index 31 and idles in a nearly flat sub-zero channel into the high-60s.  A steady climb carries it through zero to an extended positive mesa around 0.7 that lasts into the 90s, before rising further to twin crests at indices 118 and 150 (the latter the higher).  A gentle retreat toward neutral is followed by a fresh dive to a deep pocket in the mid-180s, and the record closes with a hesitant, ripple-laden recovery.  
Best overall fit: class_3  

Signal 4  
After a tiny positive ledge, the trace plunges to an early minimum near index 10, then rockets to a tall peak at index 53.  It relaxes, swings negative again into a trough around index 100, falls still farther to its lowest point at index 123, and mounts a brisk ascent that culminates in the global maximum near index 160.  A renewed decline carries it back into negative territory in the 190s, after which it stages a last-minute rebound that peaks modestly in the low-220s before tapering off.  
Best overall fit: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
Beginning on a shallow negative shelf, the trace slips a little further to a local dip round index 18, then sweeps upward to its earliest and highest crest near index 74.  It plunges into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-80s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 143, slides into another long low hollow that occupies the low-170s, mounts a third marked peak at roughly index 203 and finally fades in a gently ragged decline toward the negative side.  
Best fit: class_1  

Signal 2  
After a short mildly positive opening bump the curve dives to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds to a middling crest near index 38, pauses, then surges higher to a prominent peak around index 59.  It slips away in a choppy descent that bottoms shortly after index 120, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum close to index 144, and thereafter undulates downward with ever-smaller swings, finishing a touch below zero.  
Best fit: class_2  

Signal 3  
Starting on a faint negative ledge the series makes a brief dip at index 1, then rises through paired early peaks at indices 3 and 25 (the second higher).  It tumbles to a sharp valley at index 31, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling the axis from the mid-30s into the 70s, plunges to its deepest pocket near index 79, surges onto a broad high plateau crowned around index 90, declines gradually while oscillating and sinks into another negative pocket centred near index 150.  A modest hump appears in the 160s, after which the record mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak close to index 190 before subsiding.  
Best fit: class_8  (reasonable but a weaker alternative would be class_5)  

Signal 4  
Beginning on a small positive perch the trace collapses to a deep minimum at index 10, rockets to a tall crest near index 55, relaxes, swings negative with a trough around the upper-90s, then falls still farther to its lowest point near index 145.  A brisk ascent follows, culminating in the global maximum about index 185; the signal then declines into negative territory near index 206 and finishes with a fresh climb that peaks close to index 243 before easing away.  
Best fit: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace opens on a shallow negative shelf a little below –0.9, slides slightly deeper to its first local floor at index 18, then sweeps upward through the axis to an early crest at index 55 and, after a short hesitation, to a taller summit at index 74.  From there it plunges into its broadest negative basin whose floor lies around indices 82-88, climbs once more to a secondary peak at index 116, glides down into another extended hollow centred in the mid-160s (minimum near index 167), mounts a third and highest peak at index 188, and finally fades away in gentle, slightly noisy oscillations on the negative side.  
→ best fits class_1  

Signal 2  
A brief positive ledge is followed by a modest bump, whereupon the curve dives to its deepest trough at index 17.  It rebounds to a middling crest in the high-30s, eases back and then surges higher to a peak near index 59.  A choppy descent bottoms just after index 120, after which the trace rockets to its absolute maximum at index 136.  Thereafter it undulates downward with progressively smaller swings, finishing a touch below zero.  
→ best fits class_2  

Signal 3  
The series begins near the axis, dips slightly negative at index 1, then accelerates into a sizable first crest at index 25.  It slips into a moderate valley centred on index 31, settles into an almost level trench that stretches through the mid-70s, and climbs to a broad positive plateau topping out between indices 88 and 103.  Successive higher crests appear at indices 111 and 168-170 (the latter the taller).  After a sharp sag to a deep pocket around index 148, the record stages a powerful late climb to its overall maximum at index 188, and finally declines in wavering steps to finish below the axis.  
→ best fits class_8  

Signal 4  
A tiny positive opening is cut short by a sharp fall to the first significant minimum at index 10.  The trace then rockets to a tall early peak at index 55, drifts into a long low-amplitude positive shelf lasting to about index 110, and sinks through zero into an extended shallow negative terrace that precedes a plunge to the global minimum at index 140.  A brisk rebound carries it to the overall maximum at index 180, after which it subsides again, momentarily dips negative near index 200, and mounts a fresh late climb capped by a secondary crest close to index 239 before subsiding toward the close.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Beginning on a broad, gently negative shelf that stretches through the mid-teens, the trace makes a slightly deeper dip at about index 18 before sweeping upward to its first and tallest crest near index 55. It then plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-80s, climbs again to a secondary summit around index 143, slips into another flat hollow that occupies the 180s, and mounts a third pronounced peak at roughly index 203. From there the series fades in a ragged slide that bottoms in the mid-250s and ends with a faint uptick.  
→ best matches class_1

signal 2  
After a brief flat positive opening capped by a modest bump, the curve dives to its overall minimum at index 17. It rebounds to a middling crest in the low 40s, eases, then surges higher to a peak around index 59. A choppy decline follows, bottoming just after index 90, whereupon the trace rockets to its global maximum near index 145. Thereafter it undulates downward in progressively smaller swings and comes to rest a little below zero.  
→ best matches class_2

signal 3  
The record opens just below the axis, slips briefly deeper at index 1, then climbs through paired early summits at indices 3 and 25, the second the higher. It tumbles to its deepest valley at index 31 and settles into a long, low-amplitude shelf hugging the axis through the upper 30s to about index 70. From there it lifts onto a gentle positive table between roughly indices 85 and 105, rises to a moderate hump near index 114 and a broader plateau centred on the mid-130s, then slides into an extended negative terrace whose floor lies in the 150s. A steady comeback begins in the late 160s, culminates in a fresh high near index 191, and is followed by a protracted, mildly choppy decline toward the close.  
→ best matches class_5  (alternative but poorer fits: class_3)

signal 4  
Starting with a tiny positive ledge, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 10, rockets to a tall peak at index 55, relaxes, then swings negative again to a trough near index 100 and sinks still further to its lowest point around index 126. It next mounts a brisk ascent that delivers the global maximum near index 171, declines once more into negative territory in the 190s, and finally stages a late rally whose third marked peak lands a little past index 210 before ebbing away.  
→ best matches class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record opens on a gently negative shelf a little below –0.6.  It sinks a shade further to a local floor at about index 18 (≈ –1.4), then arches upward, crossing the axis in the mid-50s and surging to its earliest and highest crest near index 75 (≈ 1.5).  A sharp plunge follows into a broad negative basin whose floor lies around index 87 (≈ –1.24).  From there it climbs again to a secondary summit close to index 141 (≈ 1.24), slides into another extended hollow centred in the low-170s (bottom ≈ –1.27), then mounts a third pronounced peak a few dozen steps later (≈ index 185-210, height ≈ 1.6).  The trace thereafter ebbs away in small noisy undulations, ending on the negative side.  Best fit: class_1.  

Signal 2  
After a short flat positive opening the curve makes a modest bump near index 0 (≈ 0.95) and dives to its deepest trough at index 17 (≈ –1.58).  It rebounds to a middling crest around indices 38-40 (≈ 0.3), eases back, then surges higher to a clearly taller peak close to index 59 (≈ 1.73).  A choppy descent bottoms just past index 90 (≈ –1.0); from there the trace suddenly rockets to its overall maximum near index 143 (≈ 1.9).  Thereafter it undulates downward with progressively smaller swings, throwing off lesser highs around index 187 (≈ 1.66) and finishing a little below zero.  Best fit: class_2.  

Signal 3  
A tiny positive flicker is followed immediately by a dip below the axis at index 1.  The signal then rises through twin early peaks at indices 3 and 25 (the latter higher, ≈ 1.56) before tumbling to its first and deepest valley at index 31 (≈ –1.40).  It hovers in a long, low-amplitude negative shelf from the mid-30s to the high-60s, then lifts into a moderate positive terrace culminating near index 90 (≈ 0.72).  After another quick sag to –1.24 at index 79 the trace climbs again, posting ridges close to indices 113 and 140 (around 1.3).  A prolonged negative table centred in the 150-160s (floor ≈ –1.25) precedes a late powerful ascent that reaches its second major peak near index 190 (≈ 1.70).  The record closes with a ragged descent that sinks well below zero.  This broad two-crest structure with the stronger late peak aligns best with class_8.  

Signal 4  
Beginning with a slight positive ledge, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 10 (≈ –1.07), then rockets to a tall peak around index 55 (≈ 1.94).  It relaxes briefly, swings negative again to carve a trough near index 100 (≈ –0.59), and falls still further to its lowest point at index 125 (≈ –1.77).  A brisk ascent follows, culminating in the global maximum near index 157 (≈ 2.05).  The trace then descends through zero into the negative around index 175, but rallies once more, peaking close to index 210 (≈ 1.90) before fading out.  This sequence of early plunge, twin big peaks (the latter larger) and late rebound matches class_7.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Beginning on a fairly flat negative shelf the trace sinks to a sharper dip close to index 18, then drives upward across the axis, topping out in a first tall crest about index 55 and swelling still higher to its earliest major summit near index 74.  From there it tumbles into a broad, deep basin centred in the mid-80s, rises only to a low undulating bench that stretches through the 90s into the 120s, and lifts again to a secondary peak around index 136.  A shallow hollow occupies the upper 160s before the curve plunges to its deepest pocket at roughly index 184.  It then shoots to its overall maximum a little before index 195, rolls on in gentle positive ripples with a lesser bump near index 220, and finally fades away in a noisy slide back below zero toward the close.  
best-matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
After a short positive prelude capped by a mild bump, the series dives to its first and deepest early trough at index 17.  It rebounds through a modest crest in the low-40s and surges higher to a strong peak near index 60.  A choppy descent follows, bottoming just after index 100, whereupon the trace rockets to its global maximum close to index 150.  Thereafter it undulates downward in successively smaller swings, touches another very deep pocket in the low-210s and finishes a shade above the axis.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
The record opens just above zero, instantly slips negative, then climbs through paired early summits at indices 3 and 25—the latter the taller—before plunging to its deepest valley around index 31.  A slow recovery carries it into a low-amplitude shelf extending through the 40s and 50s; a steadier rise follows, forming a moderate hump near index 113 and a broader positive table that reaches into the mid-130s.  The trace then slides into an elongated negative table with its floor in the mid-160s, after which a determined climb builds to a late major peak roughly at index 190.  Finally it ebbs away, oscillating downward and ending on the negative side.  
best-matching class: class_5  (class 8 would be a distant alternative)

signal 4  
The curve starts with a brief flicker above zero but soon falls into the red, then mounts a long ascent to an early high around index 54.  From that crest it decays almost steadily back through the axis in the 70s and settles on an extended negative terrace centred near indices 100-110.  Turning upward again, it forms a broad, nearly level summit that tops out near index 169, after which a steep drop carries it to its overall minimum just past index 195.  A late rebound lifts it to a smaller crest close to index 225 before the series eases off toward the end.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
Beginning on a gently undulating negative ledge, the trace slips a little deeper at about index 18, then swings upward in a steady arc that reaches its earliest and tallest crest near index 55. It plunges into a broad, flat-bottomed negative basin centred in the mid-80s, climbs again to a secondary summit around index 135, glides across a muted trough in the upper-160s, then mounts a third pronounced peak close to index 178 before fading away in a ragged decline that ends below the axis.  
→ best fits class_1  

Signal 2  
After a short flat positive opening capped by a modest bump, the curve dives to its deepest trough near index 17. It rebounds to a middle-sized crest in the low-40s, eases back, then surges higher to a sharper peak around index 63. A choppy descent follows, bottoming just past index 100; from there the trace rockets to its overall maximum near index 140. Thereafter it undulates downward in ever-smaller swings, finishing a little below zero.  
→ best fits class_2  

Signal 3  
The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at about index 31, then rises steadily through zero to a first positive plateau that tops out near index 90. It collapses into an extended, almost level trench spanning the high-70s through the mid-80s, climbs again to twin crests at indices 117 and 156 (the latter higher), eases back toward the axis, falls to a deep pocket centred around index 200, and closes with a hesitant, ripple-dotted recovery.  
→ best fits class_3  

Signal 4  
A brief skim above zero gives way to an early minimum near index 10, after which the series rockets to a tall peak at index 55. It relaxes into a broad shelf straddling the axis until roughly index 110, then slides into successively deeper negative troughs, the lowest lying near index 141. A vigorous ascent lifts the curve to its global maximum around index 181; another drop takes it negative again near index 210, and a final rally peaks (lower) close to index 240 before the trace subsides.  
→ best fits class_7  (alternate but weaker match: class_6)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record opens on a fairly deep, almost level negative shelf around –1.0.  A sharper dip reaches the first real floor at index 18.  From there the trace climbs through zero and makes a modest crest at index 56, then, after a brief lull, rises farther to a taller peak at index 75.  It then plunges into its broadest and deepest hollow, centred near index 87, and drifts forward in a long, very flat sub-zero table that stretches to about index 140.  A brisk upswing produces a mid-sized summit at index 148, after which the curve slides away again to a secondary low around index 198.  The signal next fires up into its overall maximum at index 207 before subsiding in a ragged sequence of small rises and falls, finishing only slightly below the axis.  
Best class match: none of the eight reference patterns fits this sequence convincingly.

Signal 2  
After a brief shallow positive prelude the curve swells into a small bump, then dives hard to its deepest trough at index 17.  A steady rebound carries it to a medium-height crest near index 40; this is followed by a pause and then a steeper surge that tops out at index 60.  What follows is an uneven slide that bottoms just past index 100, where the trace briefly touches another negative extreme.  A sudden powerful burst then propels the signal to its global maximum at index 140.  From that high point the series undulates lower in diminishing swings and ends a touch below zero.  
Best class match: class_2

Signal 3  
The series starts just above the axis, immediately slips to a shallow dip at index 1, and then rockets to an early peak at index 3.  A second, still higher crest follows at index 25.  Thereafter the line tumbles to its deepest valley at index 31 and settles into a long flat trench of small, repetitive negatives extending into the mid-60s.  A gradual climb sets in, lifting the curve across zero into a low-amplitude shelf that lasts from roughly indices 80 to 110.  A moderate hump rises near index 113 and broadens into a gentle plateau centred a little beyond index 120.  The trace then descends again, forming an extended negative table whose floor lies in the 150-160 region.  Finally the signal stages a protracted comeback that culminates in a high at index 190, after which it slides away in a loose, wavering decline.  
Best class match: class_5 (class_3 is a distant alternative)

Signal 4  
A tiny positive ledge at the opening is cut short by a precipitous fall to the first and deepest minimum at index 1.  The curve then launches a swift ascent that culminates in a tall early peak at index 53.  It relaxes through a series of smaller ripples, gliding down to cross zero and settling into an extended negative trough whose floor sits between indices 120 and 140.  From that hollow the signal climbs vigorously, reaching its global maximum near index 170, relaxes once more into negative territory around index 190, and then mounts a fresh late-stage rally that peaks close to index 210 before ebbing away.  
Best class match: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace opens on a fairly flat negative shelf a little below –1.0, slips to a noticeably deeper pocket at about index 18, then swings upward in a steady arc that breaks the axis and reaches its first prominent crest near index 55 and its tallest early summit a little later, about index 74.  From there it plunges into a broad, gently U-shaped basin whose floor (≈–1.25) sits in the mid-80s.  Emerging, it levels into a long, low-amplitude table just under the axis that lasts from roughly indices 90‒135, then lifts to a secondary bump around index 139.  The curve slides once more into a fresh hollow with its base near index 188, rockets upward to its overall maximum close to index 197, and finally rolls on through a modest late crest just after index 225 before fading away in small noisy ripples.  
Best matching class: class_1  (class_7 is a conceivable second choice).

Signal 2  
After a brief, slightly positive plateau, the series makes a mild uptick, dives to its deepest trough about index 17, rebounds to a mid-level crest in the high 30s, eases, and then sweeps higher to a strong peak near index 59.  A ragged descent follows, bottoming just past index 100, after which the trace shoots almost vertically to its global maximum close to index 146.  From that summit it undulates downward with progressively smaller swings—pausing for a lesser crest near index 184— and drifts through modest negatives before ending only fractionally above the axis.  
Best matching class: class_2

Signal 3  
The record begins with a tiny positive blip, immediately dips below zero at index 1, then vaults to a first crest near index 3 and to a still higher crest about index 25.  It rolls back through zero into a shallow basin, plunges to a pronounced valley at index 31, rises again and, after some choppy back-and-forth, descends to its deepest point around index 78.  A vigorous climb sets in, forming a broad, gently undulating plateau that tops out close to index 90.  The curve sags once more to a negative pocket centred near index 125, shows a modest hump around 160, and finally stages a powerful late-stage surge that produces a second major peak near index 200.  Thereafter it declines in a hesitant, slightly noisy fall toward negative values.  
Best matching class: class_8  (class_5 is a distant alternative).

Signal 4  
A short, low positive ledge gives way to a quick collapse that bottoms near index 10, after which the signal climbs steadily to a tall peak at about index 55.  It then slides downward, crossing zero and flattening into a broad, almost level stretch just below the axis that occupies the low-100s.  This terrace breaks into a deeper trench that reaches its floor (≈–1.8) close to index 137.  From that low the series mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 177, eases, dips briefly into the negative again in the low-180s, and ends with a fresh climb that peaks just past index 235 before tapering away.  
Best matching class: class_7  (class_8 also bears some resemblance).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1 – description  
The trace opens on a low, slightly sloping negative shelf, slips a little deeper to a local floor about index 18, then sweeps upward to a first positive crest near index 55 and to its tallest early summit around index 74.  From there it plunges through zero into an extended, almost level hollow that runs from the low-90s to the mid-160s.  Breaking free, it rises to a secondary peak close to index 129, sags into its deepest pocket near index 180, vaults quickly to a third marked crest at index 189, ripples through one more modest hump near index 219, and finally decays in a gentle, noisy drift that ends just below the axis.  
best‐fitting class: class_3  

signal 2 – description  
After a short positive lead-in the curve rolls over a small early bump, dives to its global minimum at index 17, rebounds to a middling crest in the low-40s, pauses, then pushes higher to a stronger peak around index 61.  It slides away in a choppy descent that bottoms just past index 100 and, from there, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum close to index 135.  Thereafter it meanders downward with ever-smaller swings, finishing a shade below zero.  
best‐fitting class: class_2  

signal 3 – description  
A brief positive flicker is followed almost immediately by a negative dip at index 1; the series then soars to an early crest at index 3 and an even higher summit about index 25.  It tumbles to its deepest trough near index 31 and settles into a long, shallow trench that stretches through the mid-30s up to roughly index 65.  The record climbs again onto a broad positive table peaking near indices 89 and 115 (the latter higher), eases back, plunges into another wide negative basin centred in the mid-150s, then mounts a vigorous ascent that reaches a fresh high around index 170 before sagging into a hesitant, downward-tilting close.  
best‐fitting class: class_8  (alternative, though less precise: class_7)  

signal 4 – description  
Beginning with a tiny positive blip that almost at once collapses to an early low near index 10, the signal rockets to a tall peak about index 54, relaxes and slips through zero into a long negative terrace spanning roughly indices 110–130, then sinks further to its deepest floor at index 126.  A brisk climb follows, culminating in the global maximum at approximately index 168; next comes a sharp descent that carries the trace below zero again near index 190, after which a late rebound tops out close to index 227 before the curve fades away.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Opening on a shallow negative ledge just below –1, the trace sinks a little farther to its first and sharpest dip at index 18, then sweeps upward through the axis to an early major crest at index 55 and to its tallest summit at index 74.  From there it plunges into an extended negative basin centred in the mid-80s, climbs again to a secondary peak about index 121, slides into another narrow hollow around indices 170-175, mounts a third marked peak at index 214, and finally fades in a gently noisy decline that drifts back below zero.  
→ best matches class_1  

signal 2  
After a brief flat positive start the curve makes a small bump near index 35, dives to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds to a middling crest around index 38, relaxes, then surges higher to a strong peak at index 59.  It slips into a choppy descent that bottoms a little past index 95, then rockets to its overall maximum at index 146.  Thereafter it undulates downward with progressively smaller swings and comes to rest a touch below the axis.  
→ best matches class_2  

signal 3  
Beginning just below zero, the record rises through a pair of early crests at indices 3 and 25 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 31, then recovers into a long, low-amplitude shelf straddling the axis from roughly indices 35–70.  It pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader, slightly higher plateau centred near 135, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 186 before tapering away.  
→ best matches class_5  

signal 4  
Starting with a tiny positive shelf, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 10, rockets to a tall peak at index 54, eases off, swings negative again with a trough near index 107 and falls still further to its lowest point at index 123.  A brisk ascent then drives the signal to its global maximum around index 168, after which it declines once more into the negative near the mid-180s, and ends with a fresh but smaller climb peaking close to index 199 before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Beginning on a mildly negative shelf, the trace dips a touch lower at index 18, then rises steadily past the axis to a first crest about index 55. It pushes higher still to its earliest and loftiest summit near index 74 before plunging into a broad, fairly flat trench centred in the mid-80s. From that floor it climbs again to twin high points at indices roughly 127 and 150 (the latter higher), slips away into a deep hollow whose bottom lies in the high-170s, makes a hesitant rebound to a lesser hump just after index 185, and finally drifts downward in small noisy undulations on the negative side.  
Best fit: class_3  

signal 2  
After a brief shallow positive opening the curve dives swiftly to its deepest trough around index 17, bounces only momentarily, then arches to a modest crest at index 59. A choppy descent bottoms out a little past index 100, whereupon the signal surges abruptly to its overall maximum near index 130. From this high it undulates downward with successively smaller swings, dipping into a sizable negative pocket in the high-170s and finishing with low-amplitude ripples hovering close to zero.  
Best fit: class_2  (alternate but weaker match: class_7)  

signal 3  
A tiny early uptick is followed almost at once by a small dip; the trace then leaps to an initial peak near index 3 and a higher partner around index 25. It collapses through zero into a pronounced valley centred in the low-30s, stays in an extended flat trough through the 60s, and turns upward into a low positive shelf that lasts into the low-100s. A moderate hump near index 108 precedes another descent that finds its floor in the mid-160s, after which the series rallies sharply to reach its global maximum about index 188. The late-stage strength ebbs steadily, sliding back beneath the axis and ending in a jittery negative drift.  
This overall pattern does not correspond closely to any of the eight reference classes.  

signal 4  
A slight positive tick marks the start, but the series soon slips onto a shallow negative ledge and touches an early low around index 10. It then rockets to a tall peak at index 55, relaxes, and descends into a negative basin that first flattens near index 105 and finds a deeper floor close to index 134. From there it climbs briskly to its global summit about index 165, falls away again into the negative near index 190, and mounts a fresh late-stage rise that crests near index 210 before subsiding in a gentle noisy decline.  
Best fit: class_7  (alternative, less precise: class_1)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The record begins on a gently shallow negative shelf a little below –0.6.  A brief extra dip deepens the trace to its first low (about –1.4) at index 18, after which it rises steadily through the axis, reaches a first broad positive table and an initial crest around index 55, and continues upward to a taller summit near index 74.  From there it plunges into a long, almost flat negative trench whose floor lies in the mid-80s and stretches well past index 100.  Recovering, it climbs to a moderate peak close to index 139, falls back through zero into another muted hollow in the mid-170s, then mounts a higher second crest at index 199.  A sharp slide carries the series to its deepest pocket about index 251, and it closes with a hesitant uptick that stops just above the axis.  
best matching class: class_3  

signal 2  
After a short, low-amplitude positive prelude, the wavelet makes a modest bump, then dives sharply to its absolute minimum at index 17.  A brisk rebound lifts it to a middling crest near index 40; it ebbs briefly, surges higher to a stronger peak around index 59, and begins a choppy descent that bottoms a little past index 100.  From that trough it suddenly rockets sky-ward, striking the global maximum (≈1.9) close to index 140.  Thereafter the curve undulates downward in ever-smaller swings, finishing a shade below zero.  
best matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
The series opens with a whisper of positive bias, slips into a quick dip (≈–0.9) at index 1, then vaults to an early crest near index 3.  Remaining buoyant, it steps through a higher twin-peak pair, the second and larger topping out about index 25, before tumbling into its deepest valley (≈–1.4) at index 31.  A prolonged, almost level negative trough extends through the mid-60s.  From the high-60s it climbs into a long positive bench that runs to the low-110s, fronted by a modest mound at index 97 and edged by a taller rise near index 113.  After wavering, it eases downward and sinks into another negative pocket centred around indices 150-165.  A fresh, forceful ascent then drives the curve to a second major summit close to index 190, higher than any earlier crest.  The trace subsequently slides away in a gentle, slightly noisy decline that ends well below the axis.  
best matching class: class_8  

signal 4  
Beginning with a thin positive shelf, the signal plunges to an early deep minimum (about –1.1) at index 10, then shoots upward to a lofty peak near index 55.  It relaxes, swinging back toward zero and settling into a brief positive plateau of small ripples that persists into the 90s before tilting negative and spreading into a shallow basin centred around index 115.  From there it falls still farther, reaching its overall floor (≈–1.8) near index 144.  A vigorous climb follows, culminating in the global maximum (≈2.0) at roughly index 189.  The trace then drops once more below zero in the 210-time-step neighbourhood, and finally stages a lesser late-phase rally peaking just past index 230 before ebbing away.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The record begins on a low, gently undulating negative shelf.  A slightly deeper nibble appears about index 18, after which the trace sweeps upward, crosses the axis in the mid-50s and reaches its first clear crest close to index 75.  It then plunges into a broad sub-zero basin whose floor lies in the high-80s, and idles on a flat, slightly negative terrace through roughly indices 100-135.  A second rise carries it to a lesser summit around index 142, followed by another sag into a shallow hollow centred near 170-190.  From there it springs up again, attaining its overall maximum at index 201, and finally drifts away in a noisy decline that dips sharply in the mid-250s before ending near the axis.  
Best matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
After a short calm positive opening the curve forms a modest bump, then dives to its deepest trough at index 17.  A brisk rebound lifts it to a middling crest near index 38; it softens briefly, then surges higher to a pronounced peak about index 60.  A choppy descent bottoms just after index 100, whereupon the trace rockets to its global maximum around index 150.  Thereafter it undulates downward with progressively smaller swings and comes to rest only a shade above zero.  
Best matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
The series starts just above the axis, slips to a small dip at index 1, then vaults through paired early crests at indices 3 and 25 (the second the taller).  It slides back through zero into a wide negative pocket whose deepest point sits near index 31, pauses, and plunges again to a still deeper floor around index 79.  A long, stepped ascent follows, lifting the record onto an extended high plateau spanning roughly indices 85-130.  The trace then tilts downward into another negative trench centred in the mid-160s, before mounting a powerful late climb that reaches the global summit at index 191.  In the closing section it meanders lower, sinking to fresh lows in the mid-250s and finishing below the axis.  
Best matching class: class_8 (alternate but less consistent: class_7)  

signal 4  
Commencing with a slight positive ledge, the trace tumbles to a sharp minimum near index 10, then rockets upward to a tall first peak about index 55.  A long, gentle decline carries it through zero in the mid-90s and on to a level negative terrace centred near indices 110-140, whose deepest point lies at index 139.  From that floor it mounts a vigorous ascent to the global maximum at index 179, sinks again into a steep hollow around index 208, and finally stages a renewed climb that tops out close to index 238 before fading away in small oscillations.  
Best matching class: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The record sets out on an extended shallow negative shelf a little below the axis, slips to an early local low around index 18, then sweeps upward through zero to its first – and tallest – crest at index 56.  From there it plunges into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-80s, climbs again to a secondary summit close to index 149, slides into a quieter hollow spanning the low-170s, mounts a third clear peak near index 225, and finally drifts away in a gently noisy decline on the negative side.  
→ best fits class_1  

signal 2  
After a brief flat positive beginning the curve makes a modest bump, dives smartly to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds to a middling crest in the high-30s and eases back.  It then surges higher to a pronounced peak near index 59, slips into a choppy fall that bottoms a little past index 90, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum around index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with progressively smaller swings, ending just below zero.  
→ best fits class_2  

signal 3  
Opening just under the axis, the trace rises through a pair of early peaks at indices 3 and 25 (the second distinctly higher), then tumbles to its deepest valley at index 31.  It recovers into a long, low-amplitude shelf that straddles zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 followed by a broader gentle plateau centred on about 140, falls once more into an extended negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 210 before tapering away.  
→ best fits class_5  

signal 4  
Beginning with a tiny positive ledge, the series collapses to a sharp minimum close to index 10, rockets to a tall peak at index 56, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough just after index 100 and sinks still farther to its lowest point near index 120.  A brisk ascent then carries it to the global maximum around index 170; it declines once more into negative territory near index 210, and finishes with a fresh climb peaking close to index 240 before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1 – description  
From a low, nearly level negative starting shelf the trace dips a little further to its first floor around index 18, then swings upward to a first modest crest near index 55.  A brief setback is followed by a taller early-stage peak at about index 74, after which the curve plunges into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-80s.  It climbs again to a secondary summit close to index 140, slides into an extended hollow that occupies roughly indices 170-180, and then lifts to a third pronounced peak around index 198.  Beyond that the record grows noisier, slipping back through zero and touching a late deep pocket near index 250 before ending with only a faint after-bump.  

Best–matching class: class_1  


signal 2 – description  
A short positive fore-ledge is capped by a small bump at the very start, after which the signal dives to its deepest trough at about index 17.  It rebounds to a middling crest near index 40, eases off, then surges higher to a peak a little past index 60.  A choppy descent bottoms just after index 100, followed by a sudden rocket upward that delivers the overall maximum near index 135-140.  Thereafter the curve undulates downward in progressively smaller swings, finishing a touch above the axis.  

Best–matching class: class_2  


signal 3 – description  
The record opens on a gentle negative shelf, makes a minor extra dip at index 1, and then accelerates to a sizeable early crest around index 25.  It slides back through zero into a modest basin spanning the 40s-60s, plunges to its deepest point near index 79, and bursts upward into a broad high terrace whose summit sits close to index 113.  A gradual wavering decline follows, sinking into another negative pocket in the 150s, edging up to a small mid-range hump near index 167, and dropping briefly again before a late powerful climb that reaches a second major peak just before index 190.  The final section drifts downward with ragged minor oscillations.  

Best–matching class: class_8  


signal 4 – description  
After a tiny positive blip the series collapses to a first marked minimum at index 10, then rockets to a tall peak near index 55.  It relaxes, swings negative again with a trough around index 98 and continues falling to its overall lowest point near index 126.  A brisk ascent follows, culminating in the global maximum around index 170-175.  The trace then declines once more into negative territory in the 190s and finishes with a fresh climb that produces a late-stage crest a little beyond index 210 before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
Beginning on a shallow sub-zero shelf, the trace curls down to a slightly deeper pocket at about index 18, then swings upward to its earliest and loftiest crest near index 57.  From there it plunges into a wide negative bowl centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit roughly at index 140, slips into another flat hollow that floors in the low-160s, and finally mounts a third marked peak round index 205 before subsiding in a ragged slide that ends below the axis.  
Best matching class: class_1  

Signal 2  
After a brief low-amplitude positive ledge the curve dives to a sharp minimum around index 17, rockets to a tall peak at index 59, eases back, swings negative again with a trough just past index 100 and an even deeper floor close to index 130, then climbs smartly to its global maximum near index 147.  It declines once more into the negative near index 170 and, after that, stages a fresh late-stage ascent that tops out near index 240 before fading.  
Best matching class: class_7  (the sequence of early minimum, tall peak ≈60, deeper minimum ≈115-130, highest crest ≈150, later dip ≈175 and final peak ≈220-240 follows class 7 most closely)

Signal 3  
The record starts on a mild negative perch, lifts quickly to a small crest at index 3, then drops into its deepest valley at index 31.  It hovers in an extended shallow trench through the 40s and 60s, climbs steadily to a broad positive table beginning in the high-80s, and reaches successive crests about indices 114 and 191, the latter higher.  Between these highs it sinks into a distinct negative pocket centred near index 150.  After the last crest it drifts downward in widening ripples and finishes well below zero.  
Best matching class: class_8  (early dip, early peak, mid-record deep trough ≈70-80, high plateau ≈90, pocket ≈120-150, hump ≈160-190, final fall)

Signal 4  
Opening close to the axis the signal at first wavers slightly negative, then embarks on a long climb that culminates in a strong crest around index 55.  A gentle terrace follows until the high-90s, after which the trace slides into a prolonged negative bench that bottoms steeply near index 135.  A powerful rebound drives the curve to its overall maximum near index 175; it falls away once again into a deep hollow centred in the low-200s, and finally rallies to a smaller late peak about index 238 before ebbing away.  
None of the supplied reference classes reproduces this sequence closely enough (its ordering of peaks and basins, and the indices at which they occur, differ too much from every template).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Opening on a shallow negative shelf a little below –0.6, the trace makes a sharper dip to its deepest hollow near index 18, then swings steadily upward, crossing the axis and cresting for the first time at about index 55. It pushes still higher to its global maximum around index 74 before plunging into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-80 s. From there it creeps forward along an extended near-flat ledge just under zero until roughly index 150, where it lifts to a secondary summit. A fresh slide forms another muted hollow in the high-160 s, followed by a third pronounced peak close to index 213. The signal then ebbs away in a gently noisy decline that finishes on the negative side.  
best-matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
After a short, mildly positive start that produces a tiny bump, the curve dives steeply to its overall minimum at index 17. It rebounds to a middling crest in the upper-30 s, eases back, then surges higher to a stronger peak near index 60. A choppy fall follows, bottoming just after index 100, and is succeeded by a dramatic climb that launches the series to its absolute maximum around indices 138-140. Thereafter the record undulates downward in progressively smaller swings—alternating modest humps and negative pockets—and ends a shade below zero.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
The record starts with a brief positive blip and leaps to an early high at index 3. It then decays almost monotonically, crosses below the axis and settles into a long, nearly level negative terrace stretching through roughly indices 35–70. Turning upward, it rises onto a broad, gently wavy top whose crown sits near index 113, afterwards sliding sharply into a deep trough centred in the mid-160 s. A vigorous recovery carries the trace to a taller late crest around index 190, after which it subsides again in an irregular descent that finishes moderately below zero.  
best-matching class: class_4  

signal 4  
Beginning with a tiny positive ledge, the series collapses to a sharp minimum about index 10, then rockets to a tall peak at index 55. It relaxes, dropping into another trough just beyond index 120 and an even deeper floor near index 140, before mounting a brisk ascent that reaches the global maximum close to index 180. A renewed decline carries the curve back into negative ground near index 220, yet it rallies once more to a fresh late-stage summit around index 250, and finally drifts downward toward the close.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The record sets out on a low, almost level negative shelf, slides a touch deeper to its first little pocket at about index 18, then sweeps upward in an unbroken climb to a tall early crest close to index 74.  From that summit it plunges into a broad, clearly-defined negative basin centred in the mid-80s, rises again to a secondary peak a little above the axis near index 142, sinks back into a shallow trough that bottoms in the mid-190s, and mounts a third marked crest – only slightly the largest of the three – round index 205.  After that the trace wavers downward, including a sharp late dip near 236, and finishes in a ragged drift on the negative side.  
best-matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
A brief flat positive opening is capped by a small bump, after which the curve dives straight to its deepest trough at index 17.  It rebounds to a modest hump around the low-40s, slips a little, then rockets higher to a strong crest near index 60.  A choppy drop reaches another floor just past index 100, followed by a sudden leap to the overall maximum at index 139.  From there the signal undulates gradually downward with diminishing swings, ending only slightly above the zero line.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
Beginning only fractionally above zero, the series drops quickly to a mild negative ledge, then surges to paired early crests at indices 3 and 25 (the second the higher).  A head-long fall bottoms at index 31, after which the trace hugs a shallow, almost level trench through the mid-30s to about index 60.  It climbs into a long, low-amplitude shelf straddling the axis between roughly indices 80 and 110, rises to a rounded hump near index 115, and eases back.  A much deeper negative table whose floor lies in the upper-150s precedes a renewed ascent that peaks around index 177, after which the curve fades steadily into a broad descent peppered with minor ripples and ends below zero.  
best guess: fits class_5 most closely (alternative, though poorer, match could be class_3).  

signal 4  
The run starts with a tiny positive step, drops sharply to a first minimum at index 10, then launches a rapid ascent that reaches a tall peak at index 56.  It relaxes and crosses the axis, settling into a shallow negative shelf stretching through the low-100s.  A steeper descent carves out the overall lowest pocket at index 133 (with a secondary dip near 140), after which the trace rebounds, touching zero near index 150, hesitates, and then climbs briskly to its global summit around index 171.  A fresh decline pushes it negative again in the high-180s, but the signal rallies once more, capping a late crest close to index 220 before subsiding toward the finish.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace starts on a gently sloping negative shelf of about –0.6, dips a little further to a local nadir near index 18, then rises across the axis to a first crest around index 55.  Momentum carries it higher to an even taller summit close to index 74 before it plunges into its deepest early basin in the high-80s.  From the low-90s to roughly index 140 the curve hugs a flat strip only slightly below zero, after which it lifts to a secondary peak near index 144.  It slides again into an extended hollow whose floor lies in the neighbourhood of index 190, mounts a strong late-stage crest at about index 210, and finally ebbs away in a fitful decline that ends on the negative side.  
best-matching class: class_5  

signal 2  
A short, low positive shelf opens the record, followed by a mild hump and a head-long dive to the overall minimum at roughly index 17.  The signal rebounds to a modest crest in the upper-30s, hesitates, and then drives upward to a tall peak close to index 59.  A choppy descent bottoms a little beyond index 90, after which the curve rockets to its global maximum around indices 115-120.  Thereafter it undulates downward, throwing off smaller crests (one near 160, another near 190) while steadily losing height and finishing a touch below zero.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
The series opens on a mild negative ledge, makes a tiny extra dip at index 1, and then surges to an early sizeable crest near index 25.  It collapses through zero into a broad, almost level trench stretching from the mid-30s to about index 65, reclimbs and briefly touches its deepest point in the high-70s, then shoots up into a high flat top whose summit sits close to index 90.  After a wavering decline it slips into another negative pocket centred roughly on index 140, rises to a modest hump near index 170, drops briefly again, and finally launches a powerful late ascent that crowns at about index 190 before drifting down in scattered ripples.  
best-matching class: class_8  

signal 4  
Beginning on a tiny positive ledge, the curve collapses to a deep minimum near index 10, then rockets to a tall peak around index 56.  It relaxes and turns negative, skimming a trough near index 90 and sinking still lower to its absolute floor at about index 113.  A brisk ascent follows, culminating in the global maximum close to index 156, after which the trace falls once more into the negative with a low near index 190.  A fresh climb produces a late-stage crest just past index 210 before the signal eases away.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Beginning on a mildly negative ledge, the trace drops to its first and deepest dip at about index 18, then sweeps upward in a smooth, almost unbroken climb that reaches its overall maximum near index 74.  From that crest it tumbles into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-80s, afterwards recovering to a secondary summit around index 130.  A fresh slide carries the curve into another extended hollow that lies roughly in the 150s–160s, whence it mounts a third pronounced peak close to index 170.  Thereafter the line drifts downward with gentle, noisy ripples, finishing a little below the axis.  
Best‐matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
After a short, slightly positive start the series forms a small bump in the single-digit indices, then plunges to its deepest trough at index 17.  It rebounds to a modest crest near index 40, eases back, surges higher to a more prominent peak in the low-60s, and then slides in a choppy descent that bottoms just past index 100.  A sudden, steep rise propels the signal to its global maximum around index 140.  From there it undulates downward in steadily shrinking swings and ends a little below zero.  
Best‐matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
The record opens on a slight negative shelf, dips a little further at index 1, and then climbs steadily through the axis to an early positive plateau that tops out near index 15.  It presses on to a first peak about index 25 before collapsing into an extended, very flat trench of nearly constant depth from the mid-30s through roughly index 65.  A renewed ascent carries the line to crests near indices 90 and 115 (the latter higher), after which it eases back toward the axis, drops into a pronounced pocket centred around index 170-180, and finally stages a hesitant recovery sprinkled with minor ripples toward the close.  
Best‐matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
Starting on a modest positive ledge, the curve makes a first local high near index 15, then decays almost monotonically through zero by the mid-40s and settles into a long, level negative terrace that occupies the band around indices 70-90.  It next swings upward into a broad, flat-topped ridge crowned close to index 145, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 170-175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest near index 225 before tailing off.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace starts out on a rather flat negative shelf a little below the axis, slips to a slightly deeper dip around index 18, then climbs steadily to its earliest and highest crest in the high-50s/low-60s, reaching its absolute top close to index 74.  It plunges straight into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-80s, rises again to a clear secondary summit in the mid-140s (≈143), glides down into another hollow whose floor sits around indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak near 200-205 before fading in a gently noisy drift back toward the negative side.  
→ best matches class_1  

signal 2  
After a short positive pre-amble the curve dives to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds to a modest crest in the high-30s, relaxes briefly and then rockets to a tall peak near index 59.  It subsides in a choppy fall that bottoms just before index 100, sinks still further to a lower pocket around index 132, then launches a brisk ascent that produces the global maximum close to index 146.  A renewed decline carries it below the axis around 210, but a fresh climb peaks again near index 238 before the signal ebbs away.  
→ best matches class_7 (fair alternative: class_2)  

signal 3  
The record opens with a tiny positive blip, dips negative almost immediately, then arches up through paired early crests at indices 3 and 25 (the second the higher).  A head-long drop reaches a first deep valley near index 31, a shallow negative bench follows through the 50s, and the trace sinks to its overall minimum at index 79.  It then surges into a broad high plateau that tops out about index 113, slides back into an extended sub-zero table whose floor lies in the 150s, mounts a mid-range hump around index 170 and, after another brief sag, launches a late powerful climb that attains a second major peak near index 190 before tailing off in a ragged descent.  
→ best matches class_8 (possible but weaker alternative: class_5)  

signal 4  
Beginning on a small positive ledge the series drops to an initial minimum near index 10, rebounds sharply to a sizeable early crest at index 55, then drifts downward, crossing the axis just past index 100 and settling into an extended negative terrace centred around indices 110-130 with its deepest point close to index 137.  From there it undertakes a long stepped ascent that culminates in the overall maximum at index 177, after which it declines gradually while remaining on the positive side, punctuated only by gentle ripples.  
→ fits class_6 best (though some timings are offset)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
Beginning on a broad, mildly negative terrace (about –0.6) the curve slips to a sharper dip of roughly –1.4 at index 18. It then swings upward, crosses the axis and posts a first positive crest near index 56 (~1.1) before surging on to its tallest summit around index 75 (~1.5). From there it plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the high-80s (minimum near –1.2), idles in a long, nearly level, slightly-negative run until the low-130s, then climbs again to a secondary peak close to index 132 (~1.2). A slide follows to a hollow near index 160 (≈–1.3) and the trace rebounds smartly to a third marked crest just after index 170 (≈1.6). The remainder is an irregular drift downward, punctuated by a modest bump around index 200 and a gentle, noisy fade toward the negative side.  
Best fit: class_3.

Signal 2  
After a brief flat positive opening the record makes a small bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 17 (≈–1.6), rebounds to a middling crest near index 40, eases back, then surges higher to a pronounced peak around index 59 (~1.7). A choppy descent bottoms just past index 80–85 (≈–1.0), whereupon the trace rockets to its overall maximum of about 1.9 at index 127. Thereafter it undulates downward in progressively smaller swings and finishes a shade below zero.  
Best fit: class_2.

Signal 3  
A fleeting positive tick is followed by a slight dip at index 1, then paired early peaks at indices 3 (~1.3) and 25 (~1.6), the second higher. The trace then tumbles to a sharp valley at index 31 (≈–1.4) and settles into a long, almost flat, faintly negative shelf through the mid-70s. Renewed ascent leads to a shallow positive mesa topping near indices 90-115 (local high ≈1.4). After another decline the curve reaches its deepest pocket in the mid-150s (below –1.3), then stages a strong late rally that culminates in the global maximum (~1.7) near index 190. A gentle, wavering descent ends the series well below zero. This sequence does not match any of the eight reference patterns closely enough to justify an assignment.  
Best fit: no class matches.

Signal 4  
The series opens just above the axis, slips quickly to an initial minimum near index 10 (≈–1.1), and then vaults to a strong crest around index 55 (~1.9). It relaxes into a positive shelf through the 70s, sinks again and finds its deepest floor at index 113 (≈–1.8). From there a steady climb carries it to the global maximum of about 2.0 centred near index 160. A gradual falling-off follows: the trace brushes slightly below zero around index 195 and then lifts into a modest late hump near index 200 before fading out. The pattern of early plunge, substantial peak in the low-60s, still deeper mid-record trough, and later highest summit in the 150-range followed by a small after-bump matches the overall swing sequence of class 7 most closely (though with some timing differences).  
Best fit: class_7.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record opens on a broad, fairly flat negative ledge a little below –1.0; it sinks still farther to its deepest point at index 18, then climbs briskly through the axis to a first tall crest around index 55.  After a brief dip it pushes a shade higher to a second—only marginally lower—summit near index 74, whereupon the curve plunges into a wide, gently undulating negative basin centred in the mid-80s.  From there it works upward into an extended, almost level shelf sitting just below zero between roughly indices 95 and 125, lifts to a modest bump about index 130, slides again into another hollow whose floor lies near indices 177-183, and finally surges to a third and highest peak at index 192 before ebbing away through a noisy decline that finishes a little on the negative side.  
Best-matching class: class_1  (alternative but weaker fit: class_3)

Signal 2  
After a short, low-amplitude positive runway the trace makes a mild hillock, then dives smartly to its overall minimum at index 17.  It rebounds to a middling crest round index 38, pulls back only slightly, and then thrusts higher to a strong peak close to index 60.  A choppy descent follows, bottoming just beyond index 90, after which the curve suddenly rockets to its global maximum at index 140.  From that point it rolls downward in successively smaller waves—still occasionally poking above the axis—and ends a touch below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_2

Signal 3  
Starting with a tiny positive blip, the series slips negative at index 1, then spurts upward to a first crest near index 3 and a higher companion peak at index 25.  It plunges to a sharp trough at index 31, levels into a shallow, near-zero trench through the 40s and 50s, and climbs steadily into a long positive shelf whose top lies between indices 90 and 110.  A renewed sag carries the trace to a broad negative pocket centred in the 150s, but this is followed by a vigorous rise that culminates in the overall maximum (about index 172).  From there the signal slides away in a protracted, irregular decline, ending well below the axis.  
Best-matching class: class_3  (no other class matches closely)

Signal 4  
The curve begins with a modest positive step, dives quickly to a first deep minimum at index 10, then rockets to a tall early peak at index 55.  It relaxes into a gentle positive slope, crosses zero and settles onto a slightly negative flat ledge centred around indices 100-110, tumbles further to its second and lowest trough at index 129, and mounts a vigorous ascent that delivers the global maximum at index 171.  A sharp fall drags it negative again in the high-170s, but a fresh rally lifts the trace to another marked crest close to index 232, after which it drifts downward toward the close.  
Best-matching class: class_7  (alternative but weaker fit: class_4)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Starting on a shallow negative ledge (roughly indices 0-15), the trace slips a little deeper to a local dip near index 18, then sweeps upward through the axis to a first crest about index 55.  Barely pausing, it rises again to a higher summit around index 74, after which it plunges into its widest and deepest basin centred in the mid-80s.  From there it recovers into an extended near-zero shelf that stretches well past index 100, lifts to a moderate hump close to index 120 and a broader flat top around 140, then slides into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies just after index 190.  Finally it stages a strong come-back that mounts its overall highest peak near index 212 before ebbing away in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.  
Class match: class_5  

signal 2  
After a brief positive opening the curve makes a modest early bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds to a middling crest around index 38, settles momentarily, then surges higher to a pronounced peak close to index 58.  It slips into a choppy descent that bottoms a little past index 100, suddenly rockets to its global maximum near index 132, and thereafter undulates downward in ever-smaller swings, finishing a shade below zero.  
Class match: class_2  

signal 3  
The record begins on a mild negative shelf, dips slightly further at index 1, rises smartly to a sizeable early crest near index 25, glides back through zero into a shallow basin spanning roughly indices 40-60, then plunges to its deepest pocket at index 78.  A sharp surge lifts it into a broad high plateau whose crown sits in the low-90s; this plateau decays gradually while oscillating, giving way to another negative hollow centred around index 155.  From there the series climbs to a modest hump about index 170, drops briefly again, then mounts a late, powerful ascent to a second major peak just before index 190 before descending in a hesitant, noisy taper.  
Class match: class_8  

signal 4  
Opening on a small positive perch, the signal collapses swiftly to a deep minimum near index 10, rockets to a tall peak at index 54, relaxes and swings negative to a trough around index 110, falls still further to its absolute nadir near index 130, then mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum close to index 170.  It declines once more into the negative near index 190 and finishes with a fresh climb peaking near index 229 before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace opens on a mildly negative shelf, slips a little lower in a brief dip round index 18, then climbs without hurry to its earliest and loftiest crest near index 74.  From that summit it plunges into a broad negative basin centred in the mid-80 s, rises again to a secondary peak about index 113, eases down into an extended, almost level hollow that occupies much of the 130-150 range, mounts a third marked summit near index 166, and thereafter drifts away in a gently noisy decline that sinks back below the axis, touching another deeper pocket in the low-220 s before the record ends.  
best-matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
A short, slightly positive foreword is capped by a modest bump, after which the curve dives to its deepest trough at index 17.  It rebounds to a mid-level crest around index 40, relaxes, then surges higher to a stronger peak close to index 60.  A choppy descent follows, bottoming in the mid-90 s, whereupon the trace rockets to its absolute maximum near index 141.  From there it undulates downward in progressively smaller swings and finishes a shade below zero.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
Starting on a near-flat ledge that momentarily dips negative, the record leaps to an early crest at index 3 and an even taller one at index 25, then tumbles to its deepest valley about index 31.  It climbs into a broad positive mesa that stretches from the low-80 s through a gentle high near index 111, dips again into a shallow negative pocket centred in the mid-130 s, lifts to a small mid-range hump round index 162, slides briefly, and finally launches a late powerful ascent that crowns at index 188 before fading away in a steady decline to well below the axis.  
best-matching class: class_8  

signal 4  
Following a fleeting positive flicker the series falls to an early minimum near index 10, then rockets to a tall peak around index 55.  It relaxes, turns negative once more into a trough in the low-110 s, sinks further to its overall floor at index 129, and mounts a brisk ascent that reaches the global maximum near index 169.  A quick decline carries it back beneath the axis in the high-170 s, after which a fresh climb peaks just beyond index 228 before the trace subsides.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Opening on a low, slightly sloping negative ledge, the trace slips a little deeper to a local bottom about index 18, then holds in a broad shallow dip that lasts into the mid-40s.  From there it climbs smartly, topping its first clear crest close to index 55 before diving into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-80s.  A fresh rise lifts it to a secondary, lower summit near index 129, after which the curve slides into another hollow in the mid-150s.  It then surges once more, reaching its final and tallest peak around index 184, and finally decays in a gently noisy descent back toward the negative side.  

signal 2  
After a brief flat positive opening the curve makes a modest bump, plunges to its deepest trough at roughly index 17, rebounds to a middling crest near index 40, eases off, then pushes higher to a distinct peak just before index 60.  A choppy fall bottoms out a little after index 90, and this is followed by a sudden rocket-like ascent that drives the trace to its overall maximum around index 140.  Beyond that point the signal oscillates downward in progressively smaller swings, finishing slightly below the axis.  

signal 3  
Beginning just under the axis, the record rises through a pair of early peaks at about indices 2 and 3 (the second higher), then plunges to its deepest valley near index 31.  It climbs back toward zero and settles into a long, low-amplitude shelf that straddles the axis from roughly indices 80 to 110.  A moderate hump forms near index 120, followed by a broader, still higher plateau centred in the mid-130s.  The trace then sinks into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, only to mount a gradual comeback that crests close to index 190 before tapering away toward the end.  

signal 4  
The series starts with a small positive shelf, dives quickly to a sharp minimum around index 1 – 2, then rockets upward to a tall early peak near index 55.  After relaxing it swings negative again, touching a trough in the low 100s and falling further to its lowest point at about index 126.  A brisk ascent follows, culminating in the global maximum roughly at index 180.  The curve slips back into the negative in the late 190s, and finally stages a fresh climb that produces a last, more modest crest a little past index 210 before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
From a slightly sub-zero shelf the waveform takes a brief deeper dip, touching its first real bottom near index 18, then rises very gradually through a long shallow ledge that lasts into the mid-50s.  It breaks above the axis and sweeps up smartly to an early, almost top-of-the-chart crest about index 58, is nudged a little higher again around index 76, and then drops head-long into a broad negative trough centred in the high-80s where the floor lies near –1.25.  A slow climb out of that basin leads to a modest second summit around index 148, after which the trace slips once more into a short hollow straddling the low-170s.  From there it powers up to a third, clearly defined peak close to index 175 before ebbing away in a gently noisy fall that leaves the series back on the negative side by the close.  
best matching class: class_1  

signal 2  
The record opens fractionally above zero, forms a minor positive bump, then dives steeply to its deepest trough at index 17.  A rebound lifts it to a middling crest near index 40, it eases briefly, and then surges higher to a stronger peak around index 57-60.  A choppy downward drift bottoms just after index 100.  Almost immediately the curve rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, thereafter wobbling downward in ever-smaller swings and ending only a shade either side of the axis.  
best matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
A tiny positive start is followed by a quick slip to a shallow negative dip at index 1, then a brisk climb produces an early crest near index 3 and a still-higher one about index 25.  From there the curve collapses into a broad flat trench in the low-30s, hovering just below zero for some forty samples.  A steady ascent carries it through the axis to a long, almost level positive table (centre roughly index 85), after which it slides to another extended pocket of negativity whose deepest point sits in the mid-140s.  At roughly index 195 the signal mounts a powerful late-stage climb to its second major peak (also its global maximum), and finally tails away in a ragged decline that ends well below the axis.  
best matching class: class_8  (closest overall structure; class 6 is a distant alternative)  

signal 4  
A very short, low-amplitude positive ledge is followed by a plunge to an early minimum near index 10, after which the trace rockets to a tall peak at index 53.  It relaxes, swinging negative again to a trough just past index 100 and falls even farther to its absolute low in the mid-140s.  A brisk, almost continuous climb then pushes the curve up to its global maximum close to index 180.  That is succeeded by another decline that briefly takes it below zero near index 175, and the record closes with one last modest rally that tops out a little above index 220 before subsiding.  
best matching class: class_7  (class 4 is a weaker alternative)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace opens on a mild negative shelf a little below –1, sinks a shade further to a local nadir about index 18, then climbs steadily through the axis, arching over into its first clear crest near index 56.  Without pausing it pushes a little higher to attain its tallest summit – roughly index 74 – before sliding abruptly into a broad, gently undulating hollow whose floor lies in the mid-80s.  From there it idles along a long, almost level sub-axis table through the 90s and early 110s, pops up to a modest secondary peak around index 123, subsides again, drops to its deepest pocket in the low-160s, and finally mounts a third marked crest close to index 175.  Beyond that the record drifts down-hill in small, noisy ripples, ending a touch below the axis.  
best class match: class_3  (shape rather similar also to class 1, but the order, heights and spacing of the three principal peaks line up a little more comfortably with class 3).

signal 2  
A short positive ledge at the very start is followed by a head-long plunge to the overall minimum at index 17.  The curve rebounds to a first strong crest in the high-50s, eases, swings negative again and forms a choppy trough a little past index 100, then turns upward into a broad, almost flat roof that spans roughly indices 120-150 and carries a moderate top just above 1½.  A sharp dive ensues, bottoming near index 175, after which the series rallies to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before tapering away in low-amplitude fluctuations.  
best class match: class_4  (the timing of the early high, the long negative terrace, the broad roof near 130 and the late rebound round 205 follow the class-4 template most closely; class 6 is a distant second choice).

signal 3  
Beginning just below the axis, the signal shoots up through paired early peaks at indices 3 and 25 – the second the higher – then plunges to a deep valley near index 31.  It pulls out into a long, low-swing shelf that straddles zero from the mid-40s through the 70s, dips once more to a secondary floor around index 79, and climbs steadily into a moderate hump at about index 120 followed by a slightly lower broad plateau centred near 140.  A fresh slide carries it into an extended negative table whose floor lies in the mid-150s, after which a gradual comeback crests around index 188.  Thereafter it declines again, finishing on the negative side.  
best class match: class_5  (the paired early peaks, the deep drop near 60, the zero-centred shelf, mid-course humps and the later negative table all mirror the class-5 pattern; classes 3 or 7 agree less well).

signal 4  
The record starts just above zero, slips briefly negative, then rallies to a modest early high at index 15.  After a short sag it sweeps upward much more steeply, reaching a tall crest at index 57, and meanders downward through a still-positive shoulder that lasts into the 80s before falling below the axis and settling into a fairly level negative terrace centred near index 110.  It slides deeper to a pronounced trough in the low-130s, rebounds, wobbles, and finally mounts its global maximum – a broad, powerful peak – at about index 185.  From that apex it subsides progressively, ending in small positive ripples.  
best class match: class_7  (the sequence deep minimum → big peak ≈50 → two-step dive to double bottom ≈100/130 → climb to highest peak in the 180s → falling then ending with a small recovery shadows the class-7 story more closely than the other patterns).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The record begins on a broad, gently undulating negative shelf a little below –0.6.  
Around index 18 it makes a slightly deeper jab (≈ –1.4), then swings upward, crossing the axis and driving on to its first and tallest crest between indices 55 and 75 (the tip is about index 75).  From there it plunges into a wide negative basin whose floor occupies the low-80s, climbs again to a secondary summit near index 150, slides into another extended hollow centred in the 170 s, and then mounts a third well-defined peak close to index 194 before fading away in a softly rippling descent that settles below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_1  

Signal 2  
A brief positive opening (≈ 0.95) is followed by a swift dive to a sharp early trough at index 17 (≈ –1.6).  The trace rebounds to a modest crest in the upper 30 s, then surges higher to a stronger peak at index 59.  From there it sags into a choppy decline that bottoms round index 104, suddenly vaults to its overall maximum at index 118 (≈ 1.9), meanders downward with mid-range oscillations, drops still deeper into a later trough near index 155 (≈ –1.7), rises once more to smaller crests in the 170–190 region, and finally drifts toward the axis.  
The sequence of peaks and troughs does not fit any of the reference patterns closely enough to justify a match.  
Best-matching class: none  

Signal 3  
The series opens just under zero, then rises through two early humps at indices 3 and 25 (the second is higher, ≈ 1.56).  It tumbles to its deepest valley at index 31 (≈ –1.4), recovers into an extended low-amplitude shelf straddling the axis from roughly indices 80 to 110, pushes up to a moderate bump around index 118 and an even flatter shoulder centred near 140, slides again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the mid-170 s, and at last stages a measured comeback that reaches a late peak close to index 209 before tapering away.  
Best-matching class: class_5  

Signal 4  
A tiny positive ledge at the start is quickly abandoned as the curve plunges to a first deep minimum at index 10 (≈ –1.1).  It then rockets upward to a tall early peak at index 52 (≈ 1.94), relaxes, swings negative again with a trough a little past index 100, dives still farther to its absolute low near index 125 (≈ –1.8), mounts a brisk ascent that achieves the global maximum about index 162 (≈ 2.05), declines once more into strong negatives around index 180, and finishes with a fresh climb producing a late-stage crest in the high-180 s before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace opens on a low, slightly fluctuating negative terrace and sinks to an early floor about index 18.  It then climbs through paired early crests at indices 56 and 75, the second distinctly higher, before plunging to its deepest valley at index 87.  A long, almost level shelf that straddles the axis stretches from roughly indices 93-140.  From this platform it rises to a modest hump near index 145, slips back, dips to another extended hollow that bottoms at index 195, and finally stages a strong comeback reaching its overall maximum at index 204.  After that last peak the curve fades in small, uneven ripples toward the close.  
→ best fit: class_5  (the general sequence of twin early peaks, main trough, zero-centred shelf, later plateau and late-stage recovery matches class 5 most closely).

signal 2  
The curve begins a little above zero on a short flat ledge, then dives smartly to its absolute minimum at index 17.  A sharp rebound lifts it to a strong crest near index 58.  Thereafter it wavers, slips below the axis in the mid-60s and sinks into an extended negative table whose secondary floor lies in the 80-90 region.  From that level it embarks on a long, stepped ascent that forms a gentle ridge spanning roughly indices 110-150, topping just past 140.  The record then drifts downward in relatively small, still-positive undulations and ends a touch above zero.  
→ best fit: class_6  (timing of the first plunge, the main rebound, the protracted sub-zero terrace and the broad mid-course ridge mirror class 6).

signal 3  
Beginning on a mild negative shelf, the series takes a tiny extra dip at index 1, then surges to an early crest at index 25.  It slides back through zero into a modest basin whose deepest point comes at index 79, and immediately sweeps upward into a broad high plateau that peaks near index 113.  After a gentle, oscillatory decline it sinks into another negative pocket centred in the mid-160s, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 167, drops briefly again, and finally launches a late powerful climb that achieves the global maximum around index 190 before descending in a ragged fall toward the finish.  
→ best fit: class_8  (the twin-peak pattern of an early crest and a larger late crest, with the intervening sequence of basins and plateaus, follows class 8 most closely).

signal 4  
The record starts with a tiny positive plateau, plunges to a deep minimum at index 10, then rockets up to a tall peak at index 55.  It relaxes and turns negative once more, carving a trough in the low-120s and sinking still further to its overall floor near index 140.  A brisk ascent then propels it to the global maximum about index 173, after which it declines into the negative around the high-180s.  The trace finishes with a fresh climb that reaches a late crest close to index 215 before subsiding.  
→ best fit: class_7  (the order and spacing of early trough, early peak, mid-course double dip, mid-150s summit and late-stage rebound are characteristic of class 7).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace opens on an extended, mildly negative shelf that sinks to its lowest point about index 18.  From there it climbs in earnest, crests for the first time near index 55, slips briefly, then rebounds to a higher twin summit close to index 74.  It then plunges into its broadest sub-zero basin centred in the mid-80s, drifts along a flat, low‐lying table up to roughly index 130, and rises to a modest hump around index 135.  After sliding into a secondary hollow in the high-180s the curve vaults to its overall maximum just before index 200, touches a smaller late-stage crest near index 225, and finally ebbs away in a gentle, noisy descent back into negative territory.  
Best-matching class: class_5  

Signal 2  
After a brief, slightly positive ledge the curve forms a modest bump and then dives to its deepest trough at about index 17.  It rebounds to a middling crest in the mid-50s, relaxes, pushes higher to a clearer peak a little above index 60, and slides into a choppy descent that bottoms just past index 80.  A sharp surge then propels it to its global maximum near index 125; thereafter the series undulates downward in progressively smaller swings, pausing for minor up-ticks around indices 160 and 205, and settles a little below zero at the end.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

Signal 3  
The record begins with a swift dip into a tiny negative pocket, springs to an early crest at index 3, and lingers on a modest positive shelf into the 20s.  It then collapses to a broad, deep minimum near index 31.  A slow recovery carries it up through the axis and onto a wide positive table that stretches from roughly indices 80 to 110.  This is followed by a steady slide into a spacious trench whose floor lies in the mid-140s.  From that low the signal rallies vigorously, stepping through several shoulders to reach its overall peak just under index 195, before tapering away in a ragged descent that ends below the axis.  
Best-matching class: class_8  (class_7 would be a distant alternative)  

Signal 4  
Starting with gentle oscillations about the axis, the series sinks to an early trough near index 10, then rockets to a tall peak at index 56.  It relaxes into a long, low positive plateau that persists to about index 115, slips through zero into a level negative terrace in the 120s and falls further to its deepest pocket close to index 140.  A brisk rebound follows, driving the trace to its global maximum around index 176.  Thereafter it declines, dipping briefly negative again in the 190s, and finishes with a muted final uptick.  
Best-matching class: class_7  (class_2 is a weaker secondary possibility)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The record opens on a shallow negative shelf, then cuts to its first real dip (most-negative value) at about index 18.  From there it climbs through zero into a modest hump near index 57 and presses on to a taller crest around index 76.  The waveform then collapses into an extremely long, almost level table that hovers just below the axis from roughly indices 90–150, broken only by a brief lesser bump at index 119.  Next it slides into a broad hollow centred in the low 170 s, rebounds sharply to its overall summit close to index 181, drifts forward in small, mostly positive ripples and finally glides down again into fresh negative territory in the 220 s before flattening out.  
Best match: no previously defined class fits this sequence convincingly.

signal 2  
After a brief flat positive lead-in the curve makes a modest blip around index 2, dives to its deepest trough at index 17, rebounds to a mid-sized crest near index 39, eases back, then surges higher to a markedly taller peak close to index 61.  It then slips into a choppy decline that bottoms just beyond index 100, suddenly rockets to its global maximum at about index 140, and thereafter undulates downward in progressively smaller swings, finishing a little under the axis.  
Best match: class_2

signal 3  
The trace starts with a short quiet positive ledge, rises to a small bump at index 3, plunges to its deepest trough at index 31, rebounds only part-way to a middling crest in the mid-40 s, then surges higher to a more pronounced peak near index 70.  A ragged descent follows, reaching another floor just after index 130, after which the signal shoots upward to its overall maximum roughly at index 180.  From that high it meanders downward in steadily shrinking oscillations toward the close.  
Best match: class_2  (a second occurrence of the same broad motif; class 8 shows some similarities as well, but the ordering and relative magnitudes of the main features align more closely with class 2).

signal 4  
Beginning on a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 10, rockets to a tall peak at index 56, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough in the high 90 s and a still deeper low at index 124, then mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum near index 178.  It declines once more into negative ground around index 195 and ends with a fresh climb that peaks close to index 215 before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Beginning on a gently negative shelf the trace dips a little farther to a local floor near index 18, then sweeps up to a first crest in the mid-50s and to a still larger apex about index 74.  From there it plunges into a broad negative basin centred roughly at index 86, climbs out into a long almost-flat bench that hovers just below the axis through the 90s and early 130s, tops a secondary summit around index 143, glides for a while, sinks to another hollow close to index 198, and finally mounts a third pronounced peak just after index 207 before fading away in a mildly noisy decline back on the negative side.  
→ best match: class_1  

signal 2  
After a short positive start capped by a modest bump, the curve dives to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds to a middling crest in the low-40s and on to a taller peak near index 59.  It slips back, slides through a choppy descent that bottoms a little past index 100, then suddenly rockets to its global maximum around index 146.  Thereafter the trace undulates downward in ever-smaller swings, ending a shade below zero.  
→ best match: class_2  

signal 3  
The record opens just above the axis, leaps through closely spaced early crests at indices 3 and 25 (the second the higher), then drops precipitously into a deep pocket at index 31.  It levels into a long flat trench extending through the high-60s, climbs to a broad low-amplitude plateau that tops between indices 90 and 115, slides again into a pronounced negative table centred near index 160, and at last stages a strong late-cycle surge that reaches the overall summit about index 190 before subsiding in a sequence of smaller ripples toward a final shallow dip.  
→ best match: class_8  (reasonable—but a looser fit with class_5 is also conceivable)  

signal 4  
Starting with a tiny positive blip, the series sinks quickly to an initial hollow around index 10, then soars to a tall crest near index 55.  It decays unevenly through zero into a long shallow negative shelf in the 110s, plunges further to its deepest trough at index 138, surges upward to its global maximum close to index 178, slips back into negative territory near index 199, and ends with a fresh rally that peaks about index 235 before tapering off.  
→ best match: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The waveform begins on a low, almost level negative step, then dips a little farther to its absolute minimum at about index 18.  From there it swings upward in a steady arc, topping out for the first time near index 55 and immediately pressing on to its tallest crest around index 74.  This is followed by a head-long plunge into a broad, gently rounded negative basin centred in the mid-80s.  A slow recovery lifts the trace into a long, nearly flat shelf that lingers just below the axis between roughly indices 90 and 140, after which it pushes up to a secondary summit close to index 147.  The series then slides into another hollow whose floor lies in the low 170s, vaults into a third, clear-cut peak about index 215, and finally fades away in a mildly noisy descent that settles back on the negative side.  
Best class fit: class_1  

Signal 2  
After a short, mildly positive prelude the curve forms a modest bump, then plunges to its deepest trough at index 17.  It rebounds through a middling crest near index 38, eases, and surges higher to a more prominent peak at about index 63.  A ragged descent bottoming a little past index 100 is followed by a sudden, near-vertical rise that carries the signal to its overall maximum (≈1.9) around index 128.  Thereafter the record undulates downward in progressively smaller swings, finishing just below the zero line.  
Best class fit: class_2  

Signal 3  
The trace opens almost flat, nips briefly into the red, and then catapults to a sharp early crest at index 3, followed by an even higher spike around index 25.  It collapses to a pronounced trough near index 31, levels into an extended shallow negative shelf that runs from roughly indices 37 to 70, and climbs onto a modest positive table between about 80 and 100, peaking just under 1.4.  A renewed fall bottoms near index 158, after which a vigorous climb produces a broad high plateau whose summit sits in the vicinity of index 180.  From there the signal slides away in a long, low-amplitude decline that drifts back below the axis and ends quietly negative.  Although it shares scattered features with several reference patterns, the sequence and spacing of its highs and lows do not correspond well to any single class, so no convincing match can be assigned.  
Best class fit: none  

Signal 4  
Beginning on a slight positive shelf, the series quickly drops to a first local minimum at about index 10, then rockets upward to an early high that tops out near index 57.  The trace relaxes and glides downward through zero, undulating into the negative and carving out successive troughs around indices 100 and 122—the latter the deepest.  A brisk ascent then drives the curve to its global maximum (≈2.0) in the high-170s, after which it sags once more into negative territory near index 208.  Finally the record rallies to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 230 before easing off toward the close.  This pattern of early collapse, tall mid-range peak, deeper second trough, major later summit, late fall and terminal rebound accords most closely with class 7.  
Best class fit: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The record starts out on a mild, near-level negative shelf that lasts through the mid-teens.  A slightly deeper dip reaches its local minimum about index 19.  From there the trace climbs smartly, breaking the axis and arching to an early, tall crest centred about index 56–58, followed a few indices later by an even slightly higher spike near index 75.  It then plunges into a broad negative basin whose floor lies in the mid-80s.  A steady recovery carries the curve back above zero to a secondary hump around index 120 and, after a brief lull, to another pronounced summit in the mid-140s.  A second slide produces a minor hollow in the 150s; this is answered by a third marked peak near index 165.  Beyond that point the signal wanders downward in small, noisy ripples and finishes a touch below the axis.  
Best match: class_1  

Signal 2  
After a short, slightly positive prelude, the series dives abruptly to its first and deepest trough at index 17.  It rebounds in a rush to a strong crest near index 59, relaxes, and swings negative again to a choppy floor centred in the low-90s.  A brief up–down jitter is followed by a sharp ascent that tops out in the overall maximum at about index 144.  The curve then slips once more, sinking to another broad negative pocket whose bottom stands just past index 210, before launching a late surge that crests close to index 236 and finally ebbs away.  
Best match: class_7 (reason: early deep minimum, tall peak in the 50s, still deeper low near 115, global maximum in the mid-140s, fresh late-stage climb - all core features of class 7)  

Signal 3  
The trace opens only fractionally above zero, rises to a first crest at index 3 and to a taller twin peak at index 25, then tumbles head-long to its deepest valley around index 31.  Climbing out, it settles into a long, low-amplitude shelf that hugs the axis from roughly indices 70 to 110.  A moderate hump appears near index 113 and a slightly broader, almost level crown is centred in the 120s.  The signal then sinks into an extended negative table whose floor lies in the 150s, after which it stages a protracted rally that reaches a late crest near index 190.  Thereafter the oscillations diminish and the trace drifts gradually downward, ending on the negative side.  
Best match: class_5  

Signal 4  
Beginning scarcely above the axis, the curve slips quickly to an early minimum at index 10, then vaults to a tall peak near index 55.  It eases back and settles into a long, uneven descent that flattens into a shallow negative terrace between about indices 105 and 130, then falls still further to its absolute floor at index 132.  A vigorous climb follows, driving the series to its global maximum at index 172.  That high is succeeded by another drop into the negative just after index 180, before the record mounts a fresh ascent that produces a late peak a little past index 230 and finally subsides.  
Best match: class_7 (fits the class-7 pattern of an early deep minimum, an early strong peak, a double-dip with the lowest point in the low-hundreds, a dominant summit around 150–170, a decline and a renewed late crest)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
Launching from a shallow sub-zero shelf, the trace slips to a local bottom roughly at index 18-20, then sweeps upward to its first and loftiest crest around index 55-58.  It tumbles into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-80s, climbs again to a secondary summit near index 140-145, slides into another extended hollow about indices 160-165, then mounts a third marked peak just beyond index 180 before fading in a gently noisy decline on the negative side.  

Best-matching class: class_1  


Signal 2  
Following a short flat positive opening the curve makes a modest early bump, dives to its deepest trough about index 17, rebounds to a middling crest in the low-40s, eases, then surges higher to a pronounced peak close to index 60.  It slips into a choppy descent that bottoms a little past index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum in the mid-120s, and thereafter undulates downward with progressively smaller swings, ending only slightly above zero.  

Best-matching class: class_2  


Signal 3  
The record begins with a brief dip below the axis to a minor floor at index 1, vaults to an early crest at index 3, subsides and collapses into an extended flat trench whose deepest point lies near index 31 and stretches through the 60s.  From there it climbs steadily to a first positive plateau topping out around indices 85-110, crests again near index 110-120 and higher still close to index 160, then eases back toward the axis, falls into a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery mottled by small ripples.  

Best-matching class: class_3  


Signal 4  
Starting on a slight positive ledge the series plunges to an initial minimum near index 10, rockets to a tall peak at index 55, relaxes, drifts across zero into a modest plateau that lasts into the 90s, then sinks further to a deeper trough around index 127.  A brisk ascent follows, culminating in the global maximum near index 167; the curve then declines once more, dipping negative near index 176, and ends with a fresh climb that peaks close to index 225 before subsiding.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: Beginning on a shallow negative plateau, the trace dips a little further at index 20, sweeps steadily upward to its earliest and tallest crest at index 58, plunges into a wide negative basin centred in the mid-70s, climbs again to a secondary summit about index 149, slides into another extended hollow spanning indices 171-178, then mounts a third marked peak at index 212 before fading in a gently noisy decline toward the negative side.
class_2: After a short flat positive start the curve makes a modest bump, dives to its deepest trough at index 29, rebounds to a middling crest around index 40, eases back, surges higher to a peak near index 63, slips into a choppy descent that bottoms just after index 100, suddenly rockets to its overall maximum at index 140, and thereafter undulates downward with smaller swings, ending a little below zero.
class_3: The record opens on a mild negative shelf, sinks slightly further at index 22, rises steadily through the axis to a first positive plateau topping out near index 69, collapses into an extended flat trench of almost constant depth from the high-70s through the 90s, climbs again to crests at indices 117 and 149 (the latter higher), eases back toward zero, falls to a deep pocket around index 185, and finishes with a hesitant recovery dotted with minor ripples.
class_4: Starting on a moderate positive ledge, the signal climbs to an early high at index 15, decays almost monotonically through zero in the mid-40s to a long level negative terrace centred on indices 80-90, then turns upward into a broad flat top around index 130, slips into a steep decline that bottoms near index 175, and finally rebounds to a smaller late-stage crest close to index 205 before easing off.
class_5: Opening just below zero, the trace rises through paired early peaks at indices 17 and 26 (the second higher), tumbles to its deepest valley at index 63, recovers into a long low-amplitude shelf straddling zero between roughly indices 80 and 110, pushes up to a moderate hump near index 120 and a broader plateau centred on 140, falls again into a prolonged negative table whose floor lies in the 160s, and ultimately stages a gradual comeback that tops out near index 225 before tapering away.
class_6: The curve begins on a flat positive shelf, plunges to its overall minimum at index 17, rebounds sharply to a strong crest near index 43, wavers and dips below zero in the 60s, sinks further to an extended negative plateau with a secondary floor at index 99, then climbs in a long stepped ascent to a gentle ridge spanning indices 120-150, finally drifting downward in small ripples while remaining above the axis.
class_7: Starting with a small positive plateau, the series collapses to a deep minimum at index 24, rockets to a tall peak at index 48, relaxes, swings negative again with a trough near index 98, falls still further to its lowest point at index 115, mounts a brisk ascent culminating in the global maximum around index 150, declines once more into the negative near index 175, and ends with a fresh climb peaking close to index 220 before subsiding.
class_8: Commencing on a gentle negative shelf the signal makes a minor dip to a local floor at index 9, accelerates upward to a sizeable crest at index 21, slides back through zero into a modest basin in the 50s, plunges to its deepest point at index 72, surges into a high plateau whose summit sits near index 89, declines gradually while oscillating, sinks into another negative pocket centred around index 123, rises to a small mid-range hump at index 162, drops briefly, then mounts a late powerful climb to a second major peak near index 200 before descending toward the end.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The record opens on a broad, mildly negative shelf a little below –0.6; it sinks a notch farther to its first clear floor at about index 18 (≈ –1.4).  From there it sweeps upward, breaching the axis in the low-50s and reaching an early crest near index 55, then surging still higher to its overall maximum roughly at index 74.  A swift plunge follows into an expansive negative basin centred in the mid-80s, after which the curve climbs back toward zero, levels briefly, and pushes up to a secondary summit close to index 146.  It slips again, skimming a shallow hollow in the mid-170s and dipping to a deeper pocket around index 195, then mounts a third pronounced peak near index 210 before fading away in a ragged, gently descending run that finishes on the negative side.  
Best match: class_1

signal 2  
After a short, slightly positive plateau the trace makes a modest bump, then dives sharply to its absolute minimum around index 17.  It rebounds to a modest crest near index 40, eases momentarily, and then drives higher to a strong peak at about index 60.  A choppy descent bottoms just past the century mark; almost immediately the signal rockets upward to its global maximum between indices 130 and 140.  Thereafter it undulates downward with progressively smaller swings—still punctuated by brief rallies in the mid-160s and again around 230—finishing a little below zero.  
Best match: class_2

signal 3  
Beginning close to the axis the curve dips at index 1, leaps to an initial peak at index 3, softens, then rises again to a higher early summit about index 25.  A sudden collapse delivers the first major trough near index 31, followed by a shallow negative shelf that persists through the 40s-60s.  The signal then climbs into a broad positive table spanning roughly indices 80-110, with minor crests near the upper-90s, before sliding back through zero to a deep pocket centred in the mid-140s.  A vigorous rally carries it to its overall apex around index 170; from there it tumbles once more, dropping into another extended decline that deepens toward the close.  This sequence of features does not align convincingly with any of the reference classes.  
Best match: none of the given classes

signal 4  
A lightly positive opening is followed immediately by a plunge that bottoms near index 10.  The trace then rockets upward, topping out in a tall first peak at about index 55.  It relaxes into a long, gently sagging plateau, crosses the axis near indices 90-100, and sinks further to a secondary trough whose deepest point lies close to index 126.  A brisk recovery then unfolds, driving the curve to its global maximum near index 161.  After a short descent that carries it into negative territory in the high-180s, the signal mounts a final, lesser climb peaking just after index 210 before subsiding toward the end.
