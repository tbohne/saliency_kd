 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Opening a little below zero it drifts a few samples lower to its mild minimum at about index 5, then embarks on a steady upward sweep that crosses the axis near index 15.  A first rounded crest appears around index 28; after only a slight slackening the rise continues, pushing on to the overall summit – a smooth hump near index 40.  From there the trace eases down into a broad, low-amplitude shelf (roughly indices 48–65) before falling sharply to its deepest negative excursion, a narrow trough centred close to index 74.  It rebounds, oscillates gently about small values, but remains subdued until a second long lift develops; this later wave attains a secondary high (still lower than the early peak) near index 221, then gives way to a gradual, rippling descent that carries the curve back beneath the axis as the series ends.  
best–matching class: class_8  

signal 2  
The curve starts moderately negative and sinks a little farther to a shallow bottom near index 7.  A smooth, almost linear ascent then carries it above zero and on to a pronounced peak at about index 37; after a brief dip it produces a short secondary crest around index 44.  What follows is an abrupt slide, the trace plunging to a mid-run valley at index 74.  Through the next stretch it recovers only fitfully, meandering in low, noisy ripples until a broad late-series surge begins.  This final climb grows steadily and reaches the global maximum close to index 215, after which the waveform declines again in gentle undulations and finishes in negative territory.  
best–matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
Beginning below the axis, the signal edges down to a minor low at index 3–4 before turning and rising smoothly through zero (crossing near index 15).  An initial bump tops out around index 31, after which the ascent continues into its tallest crest – a rounded peak just short of index 41 and a little more than twice the opening magnitude.  The trace then slips away, oscillating downward to a shallow hollow centred near index 74, and spends a long middle span hovering slightly under zero in small, even ripples.  Late in the record it gathers strength once more, forming a modest final crest about index 221 that remains noticeably lower than the early high, and finally slides back into negative values with muted undulations.

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.

class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.

Signal 1  
It opens a little below zero and slips to a shallow minimum near index 5; from there it climbs almost monotonically, crosses the axis at about index 15 and rolls upward through an early shoulder to a first bump around index 30.  The ascent continues and reaches its highest crest—roughly twice the starting magnitude—close to index 40.  After that summit the trace eases off, rippling downward and finally diving into its deepest hollow, centred near index 82.  It then spends a long middle stretch flitting just under the axis before gathering enough momentum for one last, noticeably smaller rise that tops out around index 221.  The series ends with a gentle decline that takes it back into negative values.  
Best-matching class: class_7  

Signal 2  
The waveform begins moderately negative and edges a little lower to its first, shallow nadir at about index 7.  It then turns upward, crosses zero, and sets a rounded peak near index 34.  A brief easing is followed by a slightly taller secondary crest close to index 44.  From that ridge it slides steeply, dropping through a shoulder at index 47 and continuing on toward its most negative excursion, a deep trough centred near index 82.  A noisy recovery lifts the curve back toward small values; after wavering for many scores it accelerates again, producing a broad, late-series surge whose overall maximum occurs near index 215.  Gentle ripples carry the trace downward once more so that it finishes below the axis.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
Starting from a negative level the signal dips only briefly, then embarks on a smooth, extended rise that carries it through zero and onto a broad plateau whose rounded top lies near index 28.  A slight relaxation precedes a renewed push that produces the highest crest of the record at roughly index 41.  Thereafter the curve descends progressively and, after a sharp plunge, reaches its deepest negative pocket around index 74.  The middle third is spent oscillating close to the axis, after which a steady, late-series swell peaks near index 220—lower than the early summit—before the trace glides downward again to end in negative territory.  
Best-matching class: class_8

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
From a modestly negative opening the trace sinks a little further, touching its first minimum near index 5.  It then embarks on a smooth, steady climb that crosses the axis around index 15 and rolls on to a rounded first crest just below index 40.  A short, uneven shoulder follows, during which the curve hovers in a narrow positive corridor before pitching sharply downward.  It plunges through zero and reaches its deepest negative excursion at about index 74.  A brisk rebound lifts it above the axis again, but the recovery stalls in a noisy mid-series hollow centred in the 130s.  Thereafter the waveform gathers pace into its broadest, fastest rise, attaining the global maximum close to index 220.  From that late summit it glides back down in gentle oscillations, ending the record on the negative side.  
Best-matching class: class_1  

Signal 2  
The waveform begins somewhat below zero and slips to an early shallow bottom around index 7.  Turning upward, it crosses the axis and forms a smooth ridge whose first summit appears near index 34.  After a brief dip it surges into a second, slightly higher crest with a local peak close to index 44.  An abrupt drop then sends the trace into a mid-run valley that bottoms near index 74.  A low-amplitude, slightly negative stretch follows, after which—early in the final quarter—it launches a sustained late-series surge that rises to the global maximum at roughly index 215.  The final section descends gradually with small ripples, finishing in negative territory once more.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
Opening in negative territory, the curve dips only marginally before beginning a long, even ascent that carries it through zero and onto a broad shoulder whose first plateau peaks near index 28.  After a slight sag it climbs again to its sharpest and overall tallest crest just beyond index 40.  From that apex the trace slides downward, oscillating into its deepest trough at about index 74.  It then spends a prolonged stretch hovering a little below zero, until a late up-swell lifts it into a final, smaller crest around index 221.  A gentle decline with shallow ripples returns the signal to sub-zero values at the close.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
From a slightly negative opening the waveform drifts a little lower, reaching its shallowest dip about index 5–7.  It then embarks on a steady, smooth climb that crosses zero and lifts into an initial summit near index 26.  Rather than levelling off, the curve keeps rising and fans out into a taller, rounded wave whose tip—and overall maximum—appears close to index 40.  Immediately afterwards it drops away, first as a sloping shoulder that is still positive, then as a sharper fall that plunges through the axis to the deepest negative trough at roughly index 73–74.  A noisy rebound follows: the trace oscillates about small values through the middle of the record, then accelerates once more into a late but clearly smaller crest centred near index 220 before gliding back down to finish below zero.  
Best‐matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
The trace begins modestly below zero, edges down to a gentle bottom around index 7–8, and turns upward.  It crosses the axis smoothly, builds a first prominent peak near index 34, dips only briefly, and produces a secondary crest around index 44.  Immediately afterwards it tumbles, cutting through zero and diving to its greatest negative excursion close to index 82.  After a spell of low-amplitude ripples it gathers pace once more, launching a broad late-series surge whose highest point—and global maximum—comes at about index 215.  From that summit it eases downward again, finishing with mild oscillations in the negative region.  
Best‐matching class: class_4  (class 1 would also be plausible, but the clear double-crest at ~34 and 44 matches class 4 more closely.)

signal 3  
Starting negative, the curve sags only briefly, then undertakes a long, smooth ascent through zero.  It pauses on a low plateau that crests for the first time near index 27–29, then resumes its climb into a taller wave whose top—and absolute maximum—lies close to index 41.  A rapid descent follows, breaking through the axis and reaching the deepest dip near index 74.  Thereafter the signal oscillates in subdued fashion just below zero for an extended middle section, before lifting into one last, smaller crest around index 221 and declining gently back into the negative zone by the end.  
Best‐matching class: class_2  (class 3 shares some features but lacks the higher second crest and the timing of peaks seen here.)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace opens moderately negative, slips to its shallowest dip close to index 5, then swings upward in a smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest about index 28. After a brief easing it pushes on to its overall peak near index 40. From that high it drops away into a shoulder that levels off around index 50, drifts in low-amplitude undulations, and dives to its greatest negative excursion at roughly index 74. It then recovers, oscillates around small values through the middle of the record, turns slightly negative again beyond index 130, and finally mounts one last—but lower—crest centred near index 221 before sliding back below zero with gentle ripples toward the finish.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
Starting a little below the axis, the curve dips a shade lower to its minimum at about index 7, then embarks on a long, steady ascent that takes it through zero and up to an early peak around index 38. A short dip is followed by a brief secondary bump near index 44. Thereafter the signal falls quickly, skimming a mid-run hollow at index 47 and plunging to its deepest negative trough close to index 74. It rises again, wanders in low-amplitude ripples that dip once more into negative values near index 137, and ultimately accelerates into a broad late-series surge whose highest point—and global maximum—appears near index 215. From that summit it descends gradually, ending the record slightly negative.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
The waveform begins negative and sinks a touch further until about index 5, then rises smoothly across the axis, forming an initial bump near index 31 and attaining its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—around index 41. It drifts off that peak and oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred near index 74, after which it spends a long interval hovering just below zero. In the closing samples it lifts into a subdued late crest close to index 221 before gliding back down into negative territory at the end.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The curve opens slightly below the axis and edges a little farther down to its local minimum at about index 5.  From there it embarks on a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and arches into a first rounded crest centred a little past index 40.  After a short, uneven shoulder it levels into a modest positive plateau, then suddenly pitches downward, plunging to its deepest negative dip near index 81.  A noisy recovery follows, producing a ragged mid-series hollow around index 137, after which the trace gathers speed once more, sweeping upward into its broadest and highest surge whose summit—and global maximum—lies close to index 220.  The final section glides gently downward in small undulations and finishes on the negative side.  
→ best fit: class_1  

signal 2  
Beginning negative, the waveform sags a shade further to a shallow bottom around index 7, then pivots and climbs cleanly through zero, reaching a first prominent peak near index 37.  A brief dip is followed almost immediately by a secondary crest at about index 44.  Thereafter it tumbles, ultimately hitting its greatest negative excursion near index 74, and then rises again through a noisy shoulder.  In the last quarter the trace swells into a sustained late-series surge whose apex—and overall maximum—occurs close to index 215; from that crest it descends gradually, peppered with small ripples, to end slightly negative.  
→ best fit: class_4  

signal 3  
The record starts negative and dips only a little more over the first few samples before beginning a long, steady ascent that crosses zero and towers into its highest crest near index 41, a bit more than twice the opening magnitude.  From that summit it eases downward, oscillating toward a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72 (with a slightly deeper point one sample later).  A prolonged spell just below zero follows, after which the curve lifts again into a more modest late peak around index 221.  It then slips back beneath the axis and drifts out with gentle undulations.  
→ best fit: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The record opens slightly below zero and dips to an initial minimum near index 5.  From there it rises smoothly, crosses the axis and rolls out a broad first hill whose rounded top sits around index 38.  A brief easing is followed almost immediately by a still higher crest—indeed the global maximum—at about index 40, after which the trace drifts sideways in a noisy shoulder through the mid-40 s.  It then plunges abruptly, bottoming out in its deepest negative trough close to index 74.  The mid-section is spent wavering about the axis in modest ripples until, late in the run, the curve accelerates into a second but lower surge that peaks near index 219.  Finally it glides downward in gentle undulations to finish on the negative side.  
Best–matching class: class_8  

signal 2  
Starting modestly negative, the curve slips to a shallow low at about index 7 before turning upward, crossing zero and climbing to a first prominent peak near index 37.  After a short dip it throws up a brief secondary crest around index 44, then drops sharply toward its principal negative excursion, whose nadir appears near index 74.  The following sector forms a ragged, low-lying hollow centred roughly on index 137.  Thereafter the signal gathers pace into a broad, late-series swell whose top—and overall maximum—occurs close to index 215.  From that height it descends gradually, sporting small ripples, and ends a little below zero.  
Best–matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
The trace begins negative, sinks a shade further until about index 3, then embarks on a steady ascent that crosses the axis, develops a modest shoulder near index 30 and reaches its tallest crest—almost twice the starting magnitude—around index 41.  It then slips from that peak, oscillating downward into a pronounced hollow centred close to index 74, after which it spends an extended spell hovering just below zero in low-amplitude ripples.  Late in the series it rallies once more, producing a subdued final crest at roughly index 219 before sliding back into negative territory toward the end.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The record opens a little below the axis and drifts down to its shallowest early dip about index 5.  From there it begins a smooth, steady climb that crosses zero near index 15, pauses in a low shoulder around index 29, and then sweeps upward into its tallest crest— and overall peak—at roughly index 40.  Having topped out, the trace eases off into a broad, gently sloping shelf that sits in the low-to-mid positive range through the 40s and 50s, before tipping over and plunging to its deepest negative excursion at about index 74–82.  A brisk rebound follows: the curve flickers through a sequence of small humps and hollows, spends much of the third quarter oscillating on either side of the axis, and finally gathers for a late-series rise that attains a smaller, secondary summit near index 221.  Thereafter it slides away with mild ripples to finish on a negative note.  
→ best match: class_2  

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative, the waveform sinks a touch further to a local minimum near index 7, then turns decisively upward, crossing zero close to index 15 and rolling into a rounded first peak near index 37.  It slips briefly, only to press ahead into a slightly higher secondary crest around index 44.  Immediately afterward the trace tumbles head-long, carving out its greatest negative trough at about index 74.  A noisy recovery lifts it back toward the axis, and after a choppy middle passage it launches into a long, sustained surge whose summit—and global maximum—comes near index 214–216.  From that apex it drifts downward with small oscillations, ending once again in negative territory.  
→ best match: class_4  

signal 3  
The curve starts below zero, dips only briefly in the first few samples, and then embarks on a prolonged, smooth ascent that carries it through the origin and onto a broad high shelf peaking around index 28.  It undulates gently downward before swelling into a second—and slightly higher—crest near index 40–42.  A steady slide follows, bottoming out at the deepest trough close to index 74.  Thereafter the signal alternates smaller waves and hollows, including a late but lower maximum near index 222, before edging back beneath the axis in the closing samples.  
→ best match: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace sets off slightly negative, drifts to a modest local bottom near index 5, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero around index 16.  It gathers through a gentle shoulder into a first noticeable crest about index 28, pauses, and pushes on to a still higher rounded peak close to index 40.  From that twin-top it relaxes, staying mildly positive into the 60 s before plunging sharply to its deepest negative dip at roughly index 73.  A noisy rebound follows, the curve wobbling around small values and forming a broad mid-series hollow centred near index 137.  Thereafter it accelerates into its longest, broadest rise, the global maximum arriving near index 237, after which the signal slopes away in small ripples to finish a little below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

signal 2  
Beginning just under the axis the waveform eases to a shallow minimum at about index 7, then embarks on a long, steady ascent, crossing zero near index 16.  It tops a first modest hump around index 26, gathers speed and unfolds into a taller wave whose crest lies near index 44.  An abrupt drop follows to a low positive hollow at index 48; from there the trace meanders, then dives through zero to its deepest negative trough near index 74.  After a noisy mid-run basin centred around index 137 it swings upward once more, accelerating into a broad late-series surge whose summit—and overall peak—occurs close to index 215.  The record then descends smoothly with gentle oscillations, ending in the negative.  
Best-matching class: class_1  

signal 3  
Starting from a negative level the curve dips only slightly, then launches a smooth ascent, crossing zero near index 15 and broadening into a plateau that tops out around indices 26–30.  It eases briefly, swells again and reaches a somewhat higher global crest near index 41 before undulating gently downward.  The signal slides into its deepest trough at about index 74, climbs out and alternates smaller waves, often hovering just below zero.  In the final quarter it lifts into a lower, late peak centred near index 220 and finally slips back beneath the axis in the closing samples.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The record begins slightly below the axis and dips a little further to a shallow minimum around index 5.  It then turns upward in a smooth, uninterrupted climb that crosses zero and forms a rounded shoulder near index 37; a few samples later it pushes on to its highest crest, the global maximum, at roughly index 40.  From that ridge it relaxes gently but soon pitches steeply downward, cutting through the axis and plunging to its deepest negative trough close to index 74.  A noisy recovery follows, with the trace wavering around small values for many tens of samples, after which it gathers speed again into a broad late-series swell whose top, a little lower than the early peak, sits near index 210.  Finally it glides downward with mild oscillations to finish on the negative side.  
Best-matching class: class_8  

Signal 2  
Starting moderately negative, the curve sags a touch further to a shallow bottom near index 7, flips upward and crosses zero in a long, even ascent that sets a first prominent peak around index 37.  A brief dip is quickly succeeded by a slightly higher secondary crest at about index 45.  The trace then drops abruptly, sliding into a mid-run valley near index 48 and continuing downward to reach its most negative excursion close to index 74.  After some low-amplitude ripples it recovers, oscillates about the axis, and eventually accelerates into a sustained late-series surge whose apex—and overall maximum—lies roughly between indices 165 and 180.  Thereafter it eases back with small undulations and ends below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
The waveform opens negative, slips a little lower to a brief minimum near index 3, and then mounts a steady, smooth rise that crosses the axis and broadens into a plateau peaking around index 29.  After a slight dip it swells again, achieving its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 41.  It then declines, oscillating downward until it reaches its deepest trough near index 74.  What follows is an extended stretch of subdued, near-flat oscillations hovering just below zero.  Late in the sequence, around index 220, the signal musters a last but smaller crest before sliding back into negative territory for the close.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace opens a little beneath the zero line and dips marginally lower, finding its first and only early minimum around index 5–6. It then swings into a steady ascent, crosses the axis and swells into an initial bump near index 31 before driving on to its tallest crest—about twice the starting magnitude—at roughly index 40. From that summit it descends and ripples downward into a mid-series hollow centred in the low-70s, where the signal records its deepest negative excursion. Thereafter it spends a long spell oscillating close to the axis, ultimately lifting into a late but noticeably smaller peak near index 215, before sliding back below zero with gentle undulations toward the end.  
Best-matching class: class_7  

Signal 2  
Starting moderately below zero, the curve slips a little further to a shallow early bottom at about index 7. It then embarks on a long, almost linear climb that crosses the axis and tops out in a first rounded crest near index 35. After a short, noisy shoulder it falls only slightly, then pushes up again into a brief secondary wave that is barely higher than the first. What follows is an abrupt plunge that carries the trace to its deepest negative dip close to index 74. The signal recovers through a ragged, low-amplitude section, hovers near the axis for a while and, in the final quarter, accelerates into its broadest rise; the overall maximum is reached around index 210. From that late apex the waveform drifts back down with small oscillations, finishing negative.  
Best-matching class: class_5  

Signal 3  
Beginning in negative territory, the curve dips only fractionally lower until about index 3, then embarks on a smooth, sustained climb that crosses zero and levels into a broad shoulder peaking near index 28. After a slight relaxation it swells again, achieving its highest point—just under twice the shoulder height—around index 41. The trace then slips from that crest and oscillates downward, diving to its deepest trough near index 74. Through the middle stretch it loiters just below the axis, before lifting once more into a subdued late crest around index 220. Finally it eases downward again with light ripples to end on the negative side.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace opens just below zero and slides to an early, shallow nadir near index 5; it then pivots upward, crosses the axis and shows an initial rounded hump about index 28. The climb continues, fanning out into its loftiest crest—roughly twice the starting magnitude—at index 40. From that summit it recedes in a series of soft ripples, dipping back through zero and reaching a broad, shallow hollow centred on index 74. For much of the middle span it hovers a little below the axis, until a renewed, gentler rise lifts it to a late, secondary peak around index 219, after which the curve ebbs downward again, ending modestly negative.  
Best-matching class: class_7  

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative, the waveform sinks a touch further to its minimum near index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly through zero. It tops a first notable peak close to index 26, eases only briefly and presses on into a taller wave whose crown lies between indices 38 and 44. A brisk fall follows, bottoming in a mid-series dip (around indices 47–50) that is still above the axis; shortly afterwards it plunges to its deepest negative excursion near index 74. After a noisy shoulder the trace mounts a long, sustained late-series surge that achieves the global maximum near index 215. The run ends with a gradual, undulating descent back below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
From an already negative level the curve dips slightly over the first few samples, then embarks on a steady ascent that crosses the axis and spreads into a broad plateau peaking around index 28. A short sag is followed by a higher, overall summit at about index 41, after which the signal drops abruptly into a trough centred near index 48. Low-amplitude meandering precedes a sharper plunge to the deepest negative dip at roughly index 74. Throughout the third quarter it oscillates just beneath zero, before gathering for one last, smaller crest near index 219 and finally slipping back into negative territory toward the finish.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
It opens a little below the axis and slips to its first, fairly shallow minimum around index 5.  From there it begins a long, smooth climb that carries it through zero and on to a wide, rounded crest centred near index 40.  After a short, lumpy shoulder the trace drifts downward, remaining mildly positive until the early-70s, where it plunges decisively into its deepest negative dip at about index 82.  The curve rebounds, crosses zero again just past index 100 to produce a modest mid-series hump peaking near index 106, then sinks into a noisy hollow whose floor sits roughly at index 137.  In the final quarter it accelerates into its broadest rise, reaching the global maximum a little before index 220, and finally glides back down with gentle oscillations to finish in negative territory.  
Best fit: class_1  

Signal 2  
The trace starts moderately negative, edges a touch lower to a shallow bottom at index 7 and then turns upward, crossing the axis near index 15.  It climbs steadily to a first prominent peak around index 38, dips briefly, and rebounds into a second—and slightly higher—crest at about index 44.  From that twin-summit it drops sharply into a mid-run valley at index 47, slides into negative values and touches its deepest trough close to index 74.  A ragged, low-amplitude section follows, centred near index 137, after which the waveform gathers strength once more: a protracted late-series surge lifts it to its overall maximum close to index 214 before it eases downward again in small ripples and ends below zero.  
Best fit: class_4 (the early double-peak at ≈38/44 preceding the big plunge is the deciding feature).  

Signal 3  
Beginning slightly negative, the curve dips only marginally to a shallow low at index 4, then embarks on a smooth ascent that crosses zero and forms a first rounded high near index 35.  It slackens for a moment, pushes on to its overall summit about index 41, and slides gently down to the low–50s before dropping abruptly into a sharp negative trough centred at index 74.  The middle section wavers just below the axis, then a recovery lifts it to a secondary hump near index 106.  Another sag follows, reaching a later negative minimum around index 161, after which a broad, late-series rise carries the signal to a final crest close to index 221.  The record then glides downward in modest undulations and finishes slightly negative.  
Best fit: class_8 (early twin highs at ≈35/41, sharp trough near 74 and a broad late crest around 210–220 match this template most closely).

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace opens slightly below zero and sinks marginally to a first, shallow floor near index 5.  From there it turns upward, crosses the axis by about index 16 and unfolds into a long, smooth climb whose rounded shoulder shows up near index 30.  It then pushes on to the overall summit at roughly index 40.  A drawn-out, gently sagging plateau follows, after which the curve breaks away in a swift plunge to its deepest negative dip around index 73.  The mid-portion wavers close to the axis in low-key oscillations, but late in the run the signal gathers pace once more, producing a wide second crest—lower than the early high—peaking close to index 220.  Finally it glides downward in a series of mild undulations to finish on the negative side.  
best-matching class: class_8  

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative, the waveform slips a little further to a shallow bottom at about index 7, then reverses and climbs smoothly through zero, cresting first near index 38.  After a brief dip it throws up a smaller, secondary high at roughly index 44, before dropping abruptly into a mid-run hollow centred near index 48.  It drifts for a short while, then descends more decisively to its deepest negative trough around index 74.  A noisy, near--zero stretch follows until, late in the series, the trace accelerates into a broad surge whose apex—and global maximum—lands close to index 215.  From that late peak it eases back down, ending with gentle ripples below the axis.  
best-matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
From an already negative level the curve dips only fractionally to a minor minimum around index 3, then embarks on a long, even ascent, cutting through zero and rolling onto a broad shoulder that peaks near index 30.  It relaxes momentarily, then swells into its tallest crest just past index 40.  Slipping off that summit, the signal undulates downward, hovering near small positive values before sliding into its deepest trough at about index 74.  The middle section stays just below zero in subdued oscillations, and toward the end the trace lifts into a final, lower crest centred around index 220.  A gentle decline with small waves carries it back into negative territory in the closing samples.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace opens a touch below the axis (-0.96) and slips a little further to a shallow introductory low near index 5 (-1.15).  From there it begins a long, smooth climb, crossing zero between indices 15–16 and arching into a first rounded crest just past index 40 where it tops out close to +1.9.  A short, uneven shoulder follows, flattening into a broad shelf a little above +1 that stretches through the high-40s/50s before the waveform plunges, drilling down through zero and reaching its deepest negative dip at about index 78 (≈-1.26).  It rebounds and wanders through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137, then gathers momentum for its broadest rise, accelerating into the global maximum around index 210 (≈+1.89).  After that summit the curve glides downward, oscillating gently and finishing in modest negativity.  
Best match: class_1  

Signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative (-0.95) the curve sinks a shade lower to a shallow bottom at index 7 (-1.08).  It then rises steadily through zero, posting an initial summit near index 28 (≈+1.3).  A brief easing precedes a second, taller wave whose tip lies between indices 38–45 (≈+1.7); the two early crests are separated by a minor dip around index 41–42.  Immediately afterwards the trace falls sharply, plunging to its principal negative trough close to index 75 (≈-1.12).  A spell of low-amplitude ripples follows until, after about index 150, the signal embarks on a protracted late-series surge that climbs to the overall maximum near index 216 (≈+2.38).  Having peaked, it slides away in a gentle, undulating descent that ends below zero.  The early double-crest pattern, deepest dip at ~74 and dominant late surge correspond most closely to class 4.  
Best match: class_4  

Signal 3  
The sequence starts mildly negative (-0.87), eases fractionally lower until about index 5, then turns upward.  It crosses zero near index 15 and rolls onto an initial bump that plateaus between indices 28–32 (≈+1.3–1.4).  After a slight pause it swells further, reaching its tallest crest around index 41 (≈+2.0), just over twice the starting magnitude.  The curve then declines, slipping through zero and touching a shallow mid-series hollow centred near index 74 (≈-1.16).  For a long stretch thereafter it hovers just below the axis in gentle oscillations.  Late in the record it lifts again to a subdued secondary crest at about index 221 (≈+1.92) before sliding back into the negative zone with small undulations.  This overall shape—early bump, dominant early-40s peak, hollow near 72 and a later, lower crest—aligns best with class 7 (with a lesser resemblance to class 2).  
Best match: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace opens a shade below zero, edges down to a shallow first dip near index 5, then turns and climbs steadily, crossing the axis about index 15.  It rises in a long, smooth arc that tops out in a broad, rounded crest centred roughly at index 40.  From there it drifts through an extended, slightly noisy plateau that hovers just above one until about index 60, after which it slips and suddenly plunges to its deepest negative excursion—around -1.25—at index 74.  A choppy recovery follows, the waveform bobbing about small values through the middle third, before it gathers pace again and drives into its loftiest, most sustained surge, achieving the global maximum close to index 175.  Finally it glides downward in gentle ripples and finishes in negative territory.  
Best–matching class: class_5  

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative, the curve sinks a little further to a shallow bottom around index 7, then embarks on a smooth ascent that carries it through zero and on to a first prominent peak near index 38.  A brief dip is followed by a secondary crest at index 44, after which the signal tumbles sharply, reaching its greatest negative dip—just beyond -1.1—at index 74.  It rebounds, oscillates around the axis for a time, and ultimately launches a lengthy, late-series climb whose summit—and absolute maximum, topping two units—appears near index 215.  The trace then eases downward again with small undulations, ending slightly below zero.  
Best–matching class: class_4  

signal 3  
From an already negative start the waveform dips only a touch deeper at index 3, then begins a long, even ascent that crosses the origin near index 15 and swells into a rounded high close to index 30.  Without breaking stride it pushes on to its overall peak, a sharper crest situated about index 41.  The curve then drops briskly into a pronounced trough centred at index 74, recovers and spends the middle portion wavering in low-amplitude ripples near the axis.  In the final quarter it mounts a broad, but lower, late crest peaking a little past index 220 before slipping back beneath zero and fading out.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1 – description  
The trace opens a little below the axis, slips a shade further to its first and rather modest minimum about index 5, then swings into a long, even ascent that crosses zero close to index 15 and crests for the first time in a broad, rounded hump centred near index 40.  After a short, uneven shoulder and a spell of flat wandering it collapses in a headlong dive to its deepest negative excursion at roughly index 72-74.  From there it rallies, passes through a ragged hollow whose floor sits near index 135-140, and finally accelerates into its widest and tallest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 205-210.  The last section tilts gently downward with small oscillations, ending on the negative side.

Best-matching class: class_1


signal 2 – description  
Beginning moderately negative the curve dips a touch lower to a shallow bottom around index 7, then turns and climbs steadily through zero, reaching an initial summit near index 38.  It slips a little, then bulges into a briefer but slightly higher crest at about index 44 – still within the early wave – before plunging abruptly to a pronounced valley centred close to index 74.  The middle stretch meanders in low-amplitude ripples on either side of zero.  In the final quarter a sustained late-series surge develops, lifting the trace to its overall peak near index 165-170, after which the line eases downward again, finishing just below the axis.

Best-matching class: class_4


signal 3 – description  
From an already negative level the signal dips only briefly to a minor minimum around index 4, then embarks on a smooth, extended ascent that crosses the axis and settles onto a broad plateau whose top lies near index 28.  It relaxes slightly, then swells into a second – and noticeably higher – crest centred around index 40-42.  Thereafter it slides downward into its deepest trough close to index 74, and proceeds to alternate smaller undulations.  A late, lower maximum crops up in the last quarter (about index 185-190), after which the trace drifts back below zero toward the close.

Best-matching class: class_3

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1 – description  
The trace starts modestly below the axis and sinks a touch further during the first half–dozen samples.  From there it turns and embarks on a long, smooth climb, crossing zero near index 15 and fanning out into a rounded first hill that crests close to index 28.  After a brief easing it pushes on again, attaining its overall summit (≈ index 40) before sliding away.  The fall is at first gentle, lingering on a positive shoulder that extends to the mid-forties, but then steepens and drives the curve sharply down through zero to its deepest negative dip almost exactly at index 74.  During the mid-section the signal hovers in small, noisy undulations around the axis, then begins another sustained rise that produces a broad late-series high whose top—though impressive—is a shade lower than the early record and lies a little past index 210.  From that point the waveform declines in easy oscillations and finishes on the negative side.  
Best-matching class: class_8  

signal 2 – description  
Beginning slightly negative, the waveform slips to a shallow minimum around index 7, then swings upward, crossing zero near index 15.  It reaches an initial crest about index 37, hesitates for a couple of samples, dips a little, and immediately gathers again into a brief secondary peak near index 44.  What follows is a brisk descent: the curve plunges through small positive values and is already near zero by index 49, then drops still faster to its most negative excursion (≈ index 74).  A noisy, low-amplitude stretch centred in the 130s separates this trough from the closing act—a broad, powerful late surge that lifts the signal to its global maximum just after index 210.  The final leg is a gentle, rippling decline that ends below the axis.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

signal 3 – description  
The curve opens negative and dips a little more until about index 3, after which it rises smoothly, crossing zero near index 15.  A first, modest plateau forms around index 30; the ascent then resumes, propelling the trace to its highest crest—roughly twice the starting magnitude—close to index 41.  The signal slides off that summit and oscillates downward, touching a shallow hollow near index 72 and achieving its deepest negative value a few samples later in the high-70s/low-80s.  It then spends a long middle span fluctuating just below zero, with many nearly flat, low-amplitude stretches.  Late in the record the curve lifts again into a subdued secondary crest around index 220 before slipping back beneath the axis in the closing samples.  
Best-matching class: class_7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The trace opens a little beneath the axis, dips a shade lower to its first—still modest—minimum near index 5, then curves upward in a smooth, steady climb that crosses zero at about index 15.  It grows into a broad, rounded hill whose summit—and global peak—stands near index 40.  From that height it trickles through an extended positive shoulder, then plunges abruptly into its most negative excursion at roughly index 74.  After that dive it rebounds, spends a long spell oscillating just below the axis, and finally mounts a late but smaller rise that crests around index 220 before drifting down again in gentle undulations to finish on the negative side.  
Best–matching class: class_7  

Signal 2  
Beginning negative, the curve slides a little further to its shallowest start-up dip near index 7, then reverses and glides through zero, reaching a first rounded crest close to index 38.  A brief sag is followed by a short-lived secondary bump around index 44, after which the trace falls away sharply, glancing off moderate positive values before dropping below zero and plunging to its deepest trough near index 74.  It recovers through a noisy mid-section and then gathers strength for a long, sustained late-series surge whose highest point—also the global maximum—occurs near index 215.  Thereafter it eases downward with small ripples, ending the record in negative territory.  
Best–matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
From an already negative level the waveform sinks only briefly to a modest low around index 3, then embarks on a smooth ascent that crosses the axis near index 15 and crowns a first plateau peaking about index 28.  Without much pause it drives higher into a second—and overall tallest—crest centred near index 41.  A swift descent follows, sending the signal to its sharpest negative dip at roughly index 74; the middle section then wavers close to the axis in low-amplitude ripples.  In the final quarter it swings upward again, building a broad late hill whose top lies near index 223, before sliding back below zero with gentle oscillations to the close.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The record begins just below zero, dips a touch deeper to its first—and only—early low around index 5, then starts a long, even ascent that crosses the axis near index 15.  It climbs in an unbroken sweep to a rounded high zone whose first crest lies a little past index 37 and whose tallest early tip appears near index 40.  After a short, uneven shoulder the trace sags, wanders close to mid-range values and then plunges to its single sharp negative trough at about index 74.  From there it rebounds, passes through a choppy mid-series hollow (centred a little after index 135) and finally gathers speed into its broadest rise, reaching the global maximum close to index 220.  The waveform then glides back downward with mild oscillations, ending below the axis.  
Best-matching class: class_1  

Signal 2  
The curve opens moderately negative, slips a shade lower to a shallow bottom near index 7, and reverses into a steady climb that carries it through zero.  It forms a strong first peak around index 37, dips briefly, ticks up into a secondary crest at about index 44 and then drops abruptly toward the negative side, striking its deepest valley close to index 75.  A noisy, low-amplitude passage follows; afterwards the signal gathers strength again and, in the final fifth, launches a sustained surge whose summit—and overall peak—sits near index 216.  From that late high it eases downward once more, finishing in negative territory.  
Best-matching class: class_4  

Signal 3  
Starting already below zero, the series dips only slightly further in the first few samples before embarking on a smooth, lengthy ascent that crosses the axis near index 15 and levels into a broad plateau peaking around index 28–30.  It softens briefly, then swells into a second and somewhat higher crest centred roughly at index 41.  The trace then slides into its deepest negative excursion near index 74, after which it alternates gentler waves; among them is a late, lower crest near index 219.  Finally the signal slides back beneath the axis during the closing samples.  
Best-matching class: class_3
