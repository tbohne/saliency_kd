 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

Signal 1  
The curve opens a touch below zero and drifts to its shallowest dip at about index 5.  From there it turns upward, crosses the axis and forms an early rounded hill near index 30; without pausing it keeps climbing into a broader, taller wave whose smooth crown—and overall maximum—lies around index 37-40.  An abrupt fall then takes the trace into a narrow trough centred near index 47, after which it oscillates in low-amplitude ripples, finally sliding through zero and plunging to its deepest negative pocket at roughly index 74.  It pulls out of that hole, spends the middle third hovering close to the axis with small jitter, and, during the last quarter, builds one final but distinctly smaller crest near index 221 before easing back into negative values toward the end.  
Best matching class: class_2  

Signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative, the signal sags a little further to a minimum close to index 7, then mounts a steady ascent that carries it through zero.  It reaches a first shoulder near index 30 and, a few samples later, swells into a higher, broad crest whose tip—and global peak—sits around index 44.  A sharp drop follows, bottoming in a valley at about index 47; the next long stretch is spent in low-level fluctuations that become mildly negative through the third quarter.  Approaching the finish it gathers itself into one last rise, topping out in a secondary but smaller summit near index 222, after which it slides down again into the negative zone.  
Best matching class: class_2  

Signal 3  
From an already negative start the trace dips only briefly (minimum near index 7) before launching into a long, smooth climb that carries it through the origin and spreads into a broad high region.  This zone culminates in a clear, overall maximum close to index 61.  The waveform then steps downward through a few ripples and tumbles into its deepest trough at roughly index 74.  A modest rebound follows, after which the series wanders in gentle undulations, finally edging upward into a subdued rise that stalls near index 210 and then tails away with small oscillations on either side of zero.  
Best matching class: class_6  

Signal 4  
The waveform starts negative and continues to fall until about index 7, then turns upward, crosses zero and produces its first pronounced summit near index 37.  After a brief dip it throws up a smaller secondary bump at roughly index 44, then dives steeply to its greatest negative excursion near index 74.  It recovers through a noisy shoulder, moves sideways for a while, and ultimately gathers into a sustained late-series surge whose crest—matching or just topping the early high—occurs around index 214-220.  From that plateau it descends gradually with light ripples, finishing a little below the axis.  
Best matching class: class_4

class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
It opens a little below the axis and drifts a few samples lower to a shallow minimum about index 5; from there it sets off on a long, smooth climb that crosses zero near index 14 and rolls on to a first rounded crest close to index 37.  A short, ragged shoulder follows (high points scattered through the low-40s) before the trace slips away, hovers near small positives and then plunges to its deepest negative dip at roughly index 74.  It rebounds, wanders through a noisy mid-series hollow centred in the 130s, and eventually gathers pace into its broadest late-run surge whose global maximum appears near index 221.  After that high it glides downward in gentle, damped undulations, finishing below zero.

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative, the curve sags a touch farther to a shallow bottom around index 7, then turns upward, passes the origin and forms an initial summit near index 25.  The ascent continues into a taller, fuller wave whose tip—and overall peak—lies close to index 44.  A brisk fall carries the trace into a mid-series valley (near-zero at index 47, actually negative by the low-70s); thereafter it drifts in small ripples, spends much of the third quarter below the axis, and finally rallies into one last but smaller crest around index 220 before easing down again toward the end.

signal 3  
From an already negative level the waveform dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that cuts through zero and settles onto a broad early plateau peaking near index 28.  It then undulates gently downward, swells into a second—but slightly higher—crest around index 60, and slides into its deepest trough near index 74.  The remainder of the record alternates smaller waves, including a late, lower maximum in the neighbourhood of index 220, before edging back below zero in the closing samples.

signal 4  
The trace starts negative and continues falling to a minimum at about index 7; it then swings upward, crosses zero and builds a prominent peak near index 37.  After a brief dip it produces a secondary crest around index 44, then tumbles to its greatest negative excursion close to index 74.  A recovery through a choppy shoulder ushers in a sustained late-series rise whose highest point occurs near index 214; from there it descends gradually with mild oscillations, ending once more in negative territory.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
Starting fractionally below zero it slips a shade lower during the first half-dozen samples, then launches a long, even ascent that carries it through the axis and on to a broad, gently rounded crest whose very top – and overall maximum – occurs close to index 37.  From that height it drops away quickly, pausing on a small shoulder around index 48 before plunging to its deepest negative dip at about index 74.  The middle third is spent drifting in modest, noisy ripples either side of the axis; after a subdued recovery the trace turns positive once more and rolls into a final but smaller hill that peaks near index 221.  Thereafter it drifts downward in mild undulations and closes slightly below the axis.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
The curve opens moderately negative, edges a little lower to a shallow bottom near index 7, then sweeps upward, crossing zero and forming a first, rounded high near index 38.  Without breaking stride it climbs still higher into a taller wave whose tip – and global peak – stands at about index 44.  A sharp descent follows, reaching a mid-series trough just after index 70; thereafter the record meanders in low-amplitude fluctuations, spends much of the third quarter below the axis, and finally rises again into a broad, secondary crest centred near index 220 that falls short of the early maximum.  Gentle oscillations carry it back downward toward the end.  
Best-matching class: class_8  

signal 3  
From an already negative level the signal dips only briefly, then embarks on an unhurried, smooth climb that crosses zero and levels into a broad plateau peaking around index 28.  After a mild sag it swells again, this time reaching a slightly higher – and global – crest close to index 61.  It subsequently slides into its most negative trough near index 74, then alternates smaller, gradually damped waves, including a late, lower maximum around index 220, before slipping back beneath the axis in the closing samples.  
Best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The trace begins negative and continues falling until roughly index 7, where it turns upward, crosses zero, and forms a first prominent peak near index 37.  A brief dip is followed by a quick secondary crest at about index 44.  It then tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, recovers through a noisy shoulder, and eventually accelerates into a sustained late-series surge whose highest point – the global maximum – appears close to index 214.  From that summit it glides gradually downward, rippling gently as it returns to negative territory at the finish.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace opens a little below zero and slips to its shallowest opening dip near index 5.  From there it begins a steady, smooth climb, crosses the axis around index 15 and rises through an early shoulder that tops out in a first bump near index 29.  It then presses on into a taller wave whose round summit—and global maximum—occurs at about index 37, a little more than twice the start-of-run magnitude.  Immediately afterwards the curve drops sharply, losing roughly half its height by index 47, and continues sliding to a noisy mid-series hollow whose deepest negative point lies close to index 74.  The following sector oscillates just below the axis and wanders in low-amplitude ripples until, late in the record, the signal lifts once more, forming a last but noticeably smaller crest near index 221, before easing downward again and finishing negative.  
best class: class_2 (alternative that also resembles the shape: class_7)

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative, the waveform dips a touch further to a minimum at index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly through the origin.  A gentle swell produces a first rounded high close to index 38; after a brief slackening the rise continues, pushing on to the overall peak at about index 44.  A swift descent follows, plunging to a sharp trough near index 74.  The mid-run portion lingers around small values, flickering above and below zero.  During the final quarter the curve mounts a broad late-stage surge that crests near index 220 but remains slightly beneath the earlier maximum, and then it glides back down with mild undulations into negative territory at the close.  
best class: class_8

signal 3  
From an already negative starting level the series droops only briefly, then embarks on a smooth, extended ascent that takes it through zero and onto a broad, almost level plateau whose first top appears near index 28.  After a shallow dip the line rises again into a second—and slightly higher—crest around index 59, which stands as the global maximum.  A brisk slide carries the curve to its deepest trough at roughly index 74.  Thereafter the record alternates smaller undulations, hovers near the axis for a long middle stretch, and produces a late, lower high around index 220 before edging back below zero in the final samples.  
best class: class_3

signal 4  
The curve opens negative and continues slipping to its lowest early point around index 7.  It then reverses, climbs steadily through zero and builds a pronounced first peak near index 37.  A short dip is followed almost immediately by a secondary crest at about index 44.  What follows is a head-long plunge to the greatest negative excursion near index 74.  Recovering through a noisy shoulder, the trace eventually gathers into a sustained late-series up-surge whose highest point—and global maximum—comes close to index 214‒223.  From that summit it falls away gradually, rippling downward across the axis and finishing in the negative zone.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
It starts just below the axis and nudges a little lower, reaching an initial minimum near index 5.  From that point it turns upward, crosses zero and sweeps into a long, smooth climb whose very top—and overall maximum—sits around index 37.  The trace then slips abruptly to a shallow mid-run hollow centred near index 48, after which it wanders in small oscillations before diving into its deepest negative dip at about index 74.  A noisy, mostly negative middle stretch follows, bottoming again near index 137.  In the final quarter the curve rallies in a broad but noticeably smaller rise that crests near index 221, then drifts downward with gentle ripples to finish below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
Beginning slightly negative it drifts a hint lower to a shallow bottom at roughly index 7, then embarks on an even ascent through the origin, topping an initial rounded high close to index 38.  After a brief pause the rise resumes, pushing the waveform to its global peak near index 44.  It falls away sharply, brushing a sharp trough just past the axis near index 74, and spends the central portion oscillating modestly around small values.  Late in the record it swells once more into a broad secondary crest centred near index 210—lower than the early summit—before gliding back down into mild negativity toward the end.  
Best-matching class: class_8  

signal 3  
From an already negative level the curve dips only momentarily before beginning a long, smooth ascent that carries it through zero and onto a broad plateau whose top lies near index 28.  It eases off a touch, then rolls into a second, slightly higher crest around index 59; this second bump is the global maximum.  A slide follows into the deepest trough at about index 74.  Thereafter the signal alternates smaller, fairly regular undulations, including a late but lower peak close to index 220, and ultimately slips back below the axis in the final samples.  
Best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The trace opens negative and continues falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a strong first peak near index 37.  After a modest dip a brief secondary crest appears at roughly index 44, followed by a plunge to the greatest negative excursion around index 74.  Recovering through a noisy shoulder, it eventually launches into a sustained late-series surge whose highest point—exceeding the early peak—occurs close to index 214.  From there it descends gradually with light ripples, ending once more on the negative side.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record starts slightly negative, dips a little further to a shallow minimum near index 5, then launches into a long, even climb that crosses zero and swells through a modest shoulder round index 29 before reaching its tallest, rounded crest near index 37.  From that summit it slides away, slipping to low positive values by the mid-40 s and on to its deepest negative dip at about index 74.  It then recovers through a noisy, almost level hollow extending past index 140, spends a long spell hovering just below the axis, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 221 before gliding back down into negative territory.  
→ class_7  

Signal 2  
Opening moderately below zero, the curve falls a touch further to a shallow bottom at index 7, reverses, and rises through the axis, pausing on an initial shoulder that crests near index 26.  It pushes on into a broader, higher wave whose tip—and overall maximum—appears close to index 44; from there it drops quickly to a sharp trough at about index 74.  The middle section wavers in low-amplitude ripples that sit close to or just under zero, after which the trace mounts a broad late crest peaking near index 221 that stays slightly lower than the early high.  Gentle oscillations then ease it downward toward the end.  
→ class_8  

Signal 3  
Beginning negative with only a brief extra dip, the signal embarks on a smooth ascent that carries it through zero onto a wide plateau peaking near index 28.  It drifts down a little, then swells into a second—but slightly higher—crest centred around index 59 before plunging to its deepest trough close to index 74.  Thereafter it alternates smaller waves, producing a late, lower maximum near index 220, and finally edges back below zero in the closing samples.  
→ class_3  

Signal 4  
The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs steadily through the origin to a first prominent peak near index 37.  After a minor dip it shows a brief secondary crest at roughly index 44, tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, and rises again through a noisy shoulder.  A sustained late-series surge reaches its overall maximum close to index 214, after which the waveform descends gradually with small ripples to finish negative once more.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The curve starts a little below the axis and sinks marginally farther to a shallow minimum around index 5.  It then embarks on a steady, smooth ascent that crosses zero near index 15 and unfurls into a broad hill whose top—also the overall maximum—lies near index 37.  A short, uneven shoulder with a lesser knob about index 44 follows, after which the waveform drops abruptly, passing through small positive values and diving to its deepest negative dip centred on index 74.  The middle section shows a long spell of sub-zero meandering peppered with low ripples; it creeps back above the axis in the neighbourhood of index 151 and rises into a late-series crest around index 221 that is appreciable yet still lower than the first summit.  From that point it glides downward in gentle oscillations, finishing in negative territory.  
Best-matching class: class_7

Signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative, the trace slides a touch lower to a shallow bottom close to index 7, then turns and climbs steadily through zero.  It reaches an initial crest near index 30 before immediately pressing on into a taller wave whose tip—and global peak—occurs about index 44.  The signal then plunges abruptly into a valley at roughly index 48, after which it spends a long stretch in low-amplitude ripples that drift downward, crossing into negative values just past index 70.  During the third quarter it remains subdued, but in the closing fifth it mounts one final, smaller crest centred near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.  
Best-matching class: class_2

Signal 3  
From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then undertakes a long, smooth rise that carries it through the origin onto a broad, gently slanted plateau whose high point sits near index 28.  It relaxes slightly and swells again into a second, marginally higher crest around index 61—this is the global maximum—after which it slides into its deepest trough at about index 74.  Thereafter the waveform alternates more modest undulations, including a late, lower peak in the vicinity of index 218, before edging back below zero in the final samples.  
Best-matching class: class_3

Signal 4  
The signal opens negative and continues falling until roughly index 7, then reverses into a smooth climb, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37.  A short dip and quick rebound give a secondary crest around index 44, after which the trace tumbles to its greatest negative excursion close to index 74.  Recovering through a noisy shoulder, it eventually gathers into a sustained late-series surge whose highest point—and global maximum—occurs near index 223.  From there it descends gradually with small ripples, ending once more below the axis.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Beginning a touch below zero, the trace slides a few samples lower to a shallow minimum near index 5, then embarks on a steady climb that takes it through the axis and into a modest fore-crest around index 24.  Without breaking stride it continues upward, sweeping to its loftiest summit—just above twice the starting magnitude—at about index 37.  A sharp drop leads to an irregular shoulder near index 47, after which the waveform drifts in low-amplitude positive ripples.  It crosses downward and, in a sudden dive, reaches its deepest negative pocket close to index 74.  The middle third wanders in gentle undulations that stay mostly below the axis.  Well into the final quarter the curve lifts again, forming a last but smaller crest near index 221, then eases back with mild oscillations to close in negative territory.  

signal 2  
The curve opens moderately negative and dips a little further to a shallow bottom around index 7.  Turning upward, it passes through zero and crests for the first time near index 24, then pushes on into a broader, higher wave whose tip—and joint global maximum—appears close to index 44.  It tumbles quickly to a mid-series hollow centred near indices 47–50 and lingers there in subdued, low-positive ripples.  A swift fall at index 73–74 delivers the principal negative trough; the trace then hovers below zero before gathering strength for a second major rise that peaks, almost matching the early top, around index 220.  From that late crest it glides gently downward toward the end.  

signal 3  
From a slightly negative start the signal dips only briefly, touching its shallowest point near index 8, then launches a long, smooth ascent that crosses zero and fans out into a wide high zone whose overall maximum occurs around index 61.  Leaving that plateau, it steps down through a few rippled terraces and plunges to its deepest negative dip at about index 74.  A modest rebound produces a mid-range hump near index 106; thereafter the trace meanders about the axis and, in the last fifth, rises once more into a gentle swell that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.  

signal 4  
Opening below zero, the waveform continues to fall until roughly index 7, then reverses, crosses the axis and forms a first pronounced peak near index 37.  After a brief dip it surges into a secondary crest at about index 44, then dives to its greatest negative excursion close to index 74.  Recovering through a noisy shoulder, it eventually accelerates into a sustained late-series surge whose highest point—and global maximum—comes near index 223.  Finally the curve descends gradually, peppered with minor ripples, to finish on the negative side.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace starts a little below zero (about –1) and sinks a bit further to its shallowest opening dip near index 5.  From there it embarks on a steady, rather smooth ascent, crosses the axis at roughly index 14 and continues climbing.  A rounded shoulder shows up in the low 30 s and the curve reaches its tallest crest, a little over twice the starting magnitude, near index 37.  Having topped out, it drifts downward, first through a gently sloping high-level shelf and then toward small positive values, finally sliding through zero and on to its deepest negative excursion (≈ –1.2) centred near index 76.  The middle section is spent meandering just below the axis in a long, low-amplitude hollow whose centre sits around index 130.  Late in the record the waveform lifts again, producing a secondary but lower hilltop in the 170 – 180 region, after which it glides downward in mild undulations and finishes on the negative side.  
best-matching class: class_7  

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative (≈ –0.9) the curve dips only fractionally lower to a shallow minimum at index 7, then turns and rises through zero.  It reaches an initial summit around index 26 (~ +1.3) but keeps climbing into a broader wave whose tip—and overall peak, just above +2—appears close to index 44.  Immediately after that high it drops sharply into a mid-run valley at index 47 (still positive but far lower), then spends a long stretch in low-amplitude ripples that cross into negative territory during the third quarter; the lowest values, a little deeper than –1, lie near the mid-70 s.  In the final quarter the signal mounts one more crest, distinctly smaller than the main one, centred in the low 220 s, before easing downward again toward the close.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
The curve opens already negative, dips only slightly further during the first few samples, and then embarks on a long, smooth climb that carries it through zero and onto a broad, gently rounded plateau whose first top sits near index 28.  After a mild sag it swells into a second but fractionally higher crest around index 58.  A steady slide follows, reaching the deepest trough (just past –1) at roughly index 74.  Thereafter the record alternates smaller undulations, including a late, lower maximum around index 220, before slipping back below the axis in its final samples.  
best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The trace opens negative and continues falling until about index 7, then turns upward, crosses zero and forms a first prominent peak near index 37.  A brief dip precedes a secondary crest at index 44, after which the waveform tumbles to its greatest negative excursion (≈ –1) centred close to index 74.  Recovering through a somewhat noisy shoulder, it eventually develops a sustained late-series surge whose highest point—very close to the early peak—occurs near index 214.  Finally the signal declines again with light ripples and ends just below zero.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Beginning a little below the axis the trace glides down to a modest negative dip around index 5, then turns and climbs smoothly through zero.  A first shoulder-like crest appears near index 26, but the rise continues into a much taller wave whose top – and global maximum – sits close to index 37.  From that high the curve slides quickly into a secondary hollow at about index 47 and keeps descending until it reaches its deepest negative excursion near index 74.  Thereafter it meanders in low-amplitude ripples, spends most of the third quarter slightly below the axis, and finally lifts into one last though noticeably smaller hill centred near index 221 before easing downward again to end negative.  
best matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
The record opens mildly negative, sags a fraction further to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on a steady, almost linear ascent that crosses zero and produces an initial summit near index 26.  The climb then steepens into a higher, rounded crest whose tip – the overall peak – is found around index 44.  An abrupt drop follows into a mid-run valley at about index 47; the next hundred samples are spent in low-level undulations that drift below zero during the third quarter.  Late in the series the signal gathers itself for a final but noticeably lower crest centred near index 221, after which it descends once more and finishes on the negative side.  
best matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
From an already negative starting level the waveform dips only slightly, then launches a long, even climb that carries it through the origin onto a broad, almost flat plateau peaking near index 28.  A gentle undulation downward follows, but the trace swells again into a second – and fractionally higher – crest around index 59, which stands as the global maximum.  It then slides into its deepest trough close to index 74 before settling into a sequence of smaller alternating waves; among these is a late, lower hump near index 220.  The series concludes with a mild decline that takes the curve back below zero.  
best matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The curve starts negative, dips a touch further to a shallow minimum near index 7, then rises smoothly across the axis and makes a first rounded crest about index 25–26.  The ascent continues without pause into a taller wave capped – at the global maximum – around index 38.  A swift fall ensues to a secondary hollow at roughly index 47, after which the amplitude diminishes until the deepest negative dip is reached close to index 74.  Mid-series brings only small, noisy ripples that sit mostly below zero, but a late-running uplift forms one last, clearly smaller crest centred near index 214–222.  Finally the signal glides downward again, ending in negative territory.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Opening a little below zero, the trace dips only a touch further to a shallow minimum near index 5, then swings into a long, smooth ascent that carries it through the axis and on to its first – and tallest – crest close to index 37.  From that summit it slips abruptly into a low shoulder around index 48, oscillates gently while drifting toward zero, and finally passes negative, plunging to its deepest trough at about index 74.  A middling rebound lifts it to a modest hump near index 106; thereafter the line meanders in low-amplitude ripples until, late in the run, it rises once more, producing a smaller, last crest around index 221 before sliding back below the axis toward the end.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
The curve begins moderately negative and dips fractionally further to a local low around index 7.  It then heads upward, crosses zero and rolls over an initial mound peaking near index 30, but continues climbing into a higher wave whose tip – and joint global maximum – sits close to index 44.  A sharp drop follows, bottoming in a mid-run hollow just after index 48, after which the trace ripples with restrained amplitude, crosses into negative territory during the third quarter, and eventually gathers for one last, smaller rise whose peak lies near index 221 before easing downward again.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
From a mildly negative start the signal sinks only briefly, then embarks on a smooth, sustained climb that takes it through the origin and out onto a broad plateau whose rounded top occurs near index 28.  It drifts slightly downward, swells into a second – and overall highest – crest around index 61, and quickly descends to its deepest negative dip at about index 74.  Thereafter smaller undulations follow: a modest recovery bump just beyond index 100, further gentle waves, and a late, lower maximum near index 220, before the trace slips back below zero in the closing samples.  
best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The series opens negative and continues falling to a shallow bottom around index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and reaching a first prominent peak near index 37.  After a minor dip it produces a brief secondary crest close to index 44, then plunges to its strongest negative excursion at roughly index 74.  Recovering through a noisy shoulder, it ultimately mounts a broad, late-series surge whose highest point occurs near index 222, afterwards descending gradually with small oscillations to finish in the negative zone.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
It opens moderately negative, sinks a little further to its shallowest dip around index 5, then turns and climbs through zero near index 15. A first low crest develops around index 29, but the rising momentum carries straight on into a far taller wave whose rounded tip—and overall maximum—comes at about index 37-38. A sharp drop follows, bottoming in a shoulder near index 47; the trace drifts in low positive ripples before plunging to its deepest negative trough at index 74. During the middle third it oscillates close to the axis, then makes a renewed but gentler ascent that peaks once more near index 222, smaller than the early summit. After that late crest it ebbs away, crossing back below zero in the closing samples.  
Best match: class 2

signal 2  
Starting slightly below the axis, the curve slips a touch lower to a minimal bottom at index 7, then sets off on a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a rounded first crest near index 38. After a short, uneven shoulder it sags to low positive values, dives to its deepest negative dip right on index 74, and wanders in a noisy mid-series hollow centred about index 137. At last it gathers speed into a sweeping late-series rise, whose broad ridge at roughly index 221 towers above every earlier point, marking the global maximum; gentle undulations carry the trace back down to finish negative.  
Best match: class 1

signal 3  
From an already negative level the waveform dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that crosses the axis and levels out on a broad plateau peaking near index 28. It relaxes slightly, swells again into a second—slightly higher—crest around index 59, and then slides into its deepest trough close to index 74. Thereafter it alternates smaller waves, including a late, lower maximum near index 220, before edging below zero in the final samples.  
Best match: class 3

signal 4  
The trace begins negative, falls a little further to a minor trough about index 7, then climbs steadily through zero, reaching its tallest crest near index 38-39. A brief dip precedes a somewhat smaller secondary hump at index 44, after which the curve descends swiftly to its main negative excursion around index 74. It spends a lengthy spell hovering below the axis with low-amplitude ripples, then mounts a subdued late rise that tops out near index 216 before sliding back down into negative territory toward the end.  
Best match: class 7

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace starts a little below zero and slides only marginally lower to a shallow minimum around index 5.  From there it turns and rises smoothly, crossing the axis close to index 15.  It reaches an early, modest hump near index 26, then keeps climbing in one continuous arc whose overall summit—also the global maximum—lies at about index 37 – 38.  Having crested, the waveform falls off sharply to a shoulder near index 47, wobbles for a short spell in the low–positive range, then turns negative and dives to its deepest trough at roughly index 74.  A noisy mid-section follows, hovering about the axis, after which the signal builds a late-series upswing that tops out in a smaller, secondary crest close to index 210.  Finally it descends again with mild oscillations and ends in negative territory.  
best matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative, the curve dips a touch further to its first minimum near index 7.  It then rises steadily through zero, cresting for the first time around index 26.  The climb continues into a broader, taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears near index 44.  Immediately thereafter the trace slips abruptly into a valley at about index 48, drifts in subdued ripples and, midway through the record, sinks below zero.  In the last quarter it mounts one more but noticeably smaller crest centred near index 221 before easing downward again toward the close.  
best matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
From an already negative level the signal makes only a brief dip, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that carries it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28.  A gentle sag follows, after which the curve swells into a second—and slightly higher—crest around index 59 – 61.  It then slides into its deepest negative excursion at about index 74.  Thereafter the waveform alternates smaller waves, producing a late but lower maximum near index 220, and finally edges back below zero in the closing samples.  
best matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The series opens negative and continues falling until roughly index 7, then turns upward, crosses zero and forms a first prominent peak close to index 37 – 38.  After a minor dip it throws up a brief secondary crest around index 44 before tumbling to its greatest negative dip near index 74.  The curve recovers through a noisy shoulder, and during the final quarter produces a sustained surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples and finishes below the axis once more.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
It opens fractionally below zero, slips a little further to a shallow early dip about index 5, then turns upward in a smooth, extended climb that crosses the axis and rolls into its first rounded crest, a local high near index 37.  Leaving that summit the trace descends through a brief, uneven shoulder, wanders around small positive values, and plunges to its deepest negative excursion close to index 74.  Recovering, it passes a noisy mid-series hollow around index 110 and gathers speed into its broadest late-stage rise whose overall maximum is attained roughly at index 200–210.  From there it glides back down in gentle oscillations, finishing in negative territory.  
Best matching class: class_1  

Signal 2  
Starting moderately negative it sinks a touch farther to a shallow bottom near index 7, reverses and climbs through zero to an initial summit around index 25.  The ascent continues into a taller wave whose tip—and main peak—occurs close to index 44–46.  The record then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at about index 49, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, crosses back below zero during the third quarter, and finally mounts one last but smaller crest centred near index 220 before easing downward again toward the end.  
Best matching class: class_2  

Signal 3  
From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, steady ascent that carries it through the origin onto a broad plateau topping out near index 28.  It undulates gently downward, swells into a second—slightly higher—crest around index 59–61, then slides into its deepest trough near index 74.  Thereafter it alternates smaller waves, with a late, lower maximum around index 220, before edging back beneath zero in the final samples.  
Best matching class: class_3  

Signal 4  
The trace begins negative and continues falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a prominent first peak near index 37.  After a minor dip and a brief secondary crest round index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion at roughly index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point appears close to index 214.  It then descends gradually with small ripples, ending below zero once more.  
Best matching class: class_4

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
From a mildly negative start the trace slips to its shallowest early low at about index 5, then embarks on a steady, two-step ascent that carries it through the axis and up to a first shoulder-high at index 25; without pausing it keeps climbing into a taller, smoothly rounded wave whose very top—also the global maximum—sits near index 37. Immediately afterwards the curve drops sharply, bottoms out in a mid-run hollow around index 48 and, after a few tentative ripples, dives to its deepest negative excursion at roughly index 74. Through the middle hundred samples it meanders in low amplitudes, swings fractionally above and below zero, and only in the final quarter gathers strength again, arching into a last but noticeably smaller crest centred near index 222. From there it eases downward with gentle oscillations to finish a little below the axis.  
Matched class: class_2  

signal 2  
Beginning slightly below zero the waveform slips a touch further to a modest minimum at index 7 before reversing into a long, smooth climb. It first levels on a minor summit close to index 24, then continues upward into a broad, higher mound whose tip—and principal peak—appears near index 44. A swift slide follows, sending the trace down through an inner trough around index 48 and on into a stretch of small, noisy undulations. After turning negative in the third quarter it advances into a series of low-amplitude ripples, and then, in the last few dozen samples, rises once more to form a late—but clearly smaller—crest centred near index 221. The curve then declines gently, ending fractionally negative.  
Matched class: class_2  

signal 3  
The curve opens a little under zero, dips fractionally deeper to its earliest low at index 8, and then mounts a long, unbroken climb through the axis into a broad high zone. That plateau culminates in the overall maximum near index 61 before the signal steps down through several small ripples. It plunges to its greatest negative depth at roughly index 74, rebounds into a modest mid-series hump in the low positive range, and thereafter wavers close to the axis. Entering the last quarter it lifts once again but only to a subdued rise that stalls near index 220, after which a slow, undulating descent carries it back below zero at the close.  
Matched class: class_6  

signal 4  
Opening negative, the trace drifts down to a shallow bottom at about index 7, then swings upward, crossing zero and cresting first on a lesser bump around index 26. It pushes on into a taller, rounded wave whose apex and global maximum lie near index 38–40; a quick tumble follows, finding a mid-run valley at index 47 before the line ripples gently and finally sinks to its deepest dip around index 74. Mid-series it recovers through a noisy shoulder, stays close to the axis for some time, and eventually musters one last but distinctly smaller crest centred near index 223. From that point it glides downward in mild oscillations, ending slightly negative.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
Opening just below the axis, the waveform slips a little further to a shallow floor near index 5, then begins a long, even ascent that carries it through zero about index 14.  A first, rounded hilltop is reached near index 26, after which the climb continues, fanning out into a tall, smooth crest whose tip – and global maximum – occurs close to index 37.  From that peak it falls away steeply, skimming an uneven positive shoulder and sliding into negative territory, where it plunges to its deepest dip at roughly index 74.  A noisy recovery follows: the trace weaves around small values, rolls through a modest mid-series hollow, and finally rises once more, producing a late but lower summit near index 222.  Thereafter it glides downward in gentle ripples to finish below zero.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
The curve starts moderately negative and sags a little further to a minimum at index 7.  It then swings upward, crossing the axis near index 15 and cresting first at about index 31 before pushing on into a higher, sweeping wave whose apex – the overall high – appears around index 44.  This is followed by an abrupt drop into a mid-run valley centred on index 47, after which the record spends a long spell in low-amplitude undulations that drift into negative values through the third quarter.  Late in the run it lifts again, forming one last but smaller crest around index 220–222, and finally eases downward to close on the negative side.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
From a negative outset the trace dips only briefly, then embarks on a smooth, lengthened climb that takes it through zero and on to a broad, level plateau topping near index 28.  It edges down a little, gathers strength, and swells into a second – and slightly higher – crest around index 59.  A swift slide follows, bottoming out in the deepest trough at about index 74.  Beyond that point the record alternates smaller waves, including a late, lower maximum near index 220, before drifting gently back beneath the axis in the final samples.  
best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
Beginning negative, the signal continues to fall until roughly index 7, then turns upward in a smooth, sustained climb that crosses zero and reaches a first pronounced peak close to index 37.  After a brief dip it produces a secondary bump near index 44, then tumbles quickly to its greatest negative excursion at about index 74.  The waveform next rises through a noisy shoulder, eventually building into a broad, late-series surge whose top – and overall peak – lies around index 216-223.  From there it descends gradually in small oscillations, ending once more below the axis.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The record opens a shade below zero, glides a few more samples downward to a modest early trough near index 6, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that crosses the axis and tops out in a first rounded crest at about index 37.  From that summit it eases into a short, uneven shoulder, drifts around small positive values and then plunges decisively to its deepest negative dip centred close to index 77.  It rebounds, wavers through a noisy mid-series hollow around index 140, and ultimately accelerates into its broadest late-run rise whose high point lies near index 210, before gliding back down with gentle ripples to finish on the negative side.  
Best match: class_1  

Signal 2  
Starting mildly negative, the curve edges a little lower to a shallow minimum at roughly index 7, then climbs steadily through zero to an initial hilltop near index 26.  Without pause it presses on into a taller wave whose tip—and global maximum—appears around index 44.  The trace then drops sharply into a pronounced valley at about index 47, spends the middle segment oscillating in low-amplitude ripples, slips below zero during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the close.  
Best match: class_2  

Signal 3  
From an already negative level the waveform dips only briefly before launching a long, even rise that carries it past the axis onto a broad high-zone peaking near index 28.  It undulates gently downward, then swells into a second, slightly higher crest centred around index 59, and slides to its deepest trough near index 74.  Thereafter it alternates smaller waves—posting a late, lower maximum close to index 220—before edging back below zero in the final samples.  
Best match: class_3  

Signal 4  
The trace opens negative and continues falling to a local bottom just after index 7, then turns upward, crossing zero and forming a prominent first peak near index 37.  A minor dip is followed by a brief secondary crest at about index 44, after which the curve tumbles to its greatest negative excursion close to index 74.  It rises again through a noisy shoulder and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point sits near index 214, before descending gradually with small oscillations to finish below the axis once more.  
Best match: class_4

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
From a modestly negative opening the trace slips a little further, touching its early minimum near index 5, then arcs upward in a smooth, steady climb that crosses zero and forms a first rounded crest around index 26.  Without stopping it keeps rising into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—sits close to index 37.  A brief shoulder follows, after which the curve falls away, dipping to about one third of its crest height near index 48, and then plunges decisively into the negative to reach its deepest trough at roughly index 74.  It rebounds through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137, spends a long spell oscillating on the negative side, and finally lifts into a last but smaller crest around index 222 before gliding downward again to finish below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
The record begins slightly negative and sinks a little more to a shallow bottom at index 7.  It then embarks on a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38.  After a momentary easing it pushes on to its global maximum at about index 44, then drops sharply into a pronounced valley at index 47.  From there it slides through zero and carves a sharp negative dip close to index 74, spends the middle section wavering just below the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late-series crest whose apex—smaller than the earlier peak—appears near index 221.  The signal then subsides with small undulations and ends negative.  
Best-matching class: class_8  

signal 3  
Starting a little below the axis the curve dips only marginally, bottoming near index 7, and then launches into an extended, very smooth climb that carries it well above zero and onto a broad high shelf.  That shelf’s highest point—and the global maximum—occurs around index 61.  After stepping down through a few ripples the waveform plunges to its deepest negative excursion just beyond index 74, rebounds in a moderate mid-run hump, and later drifts upward once more toward index 210 before stalling.  The final section shows gentle oscillations that trail back into negative territory.  
Best-matching class: class_6  

signal 4  
The trace opens negative, declines until roughly index 7 and then turns upward in a steady rise that crosses zero to reach a first prominent peak near index 37.  A brief dip is followed by a slightly lower secondary crest centred about index 44, after which the signal tumbles to its greatest negative depth close to index 74.  It climbs out through a noisy shoulder and, late in the series, mounts a sustained surge whose highest point—surpassing the early peaks—appears near index 222.  Thereafter the waveform descends gradually with small oscillations and finishes below zero.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1 – Description  
The trace opens a little below the axis, slips to its shallowest early low at about index 5 and then begins a long, smooth climb, crossing zero just after index 14.  It reaches a first moderate crest near index 26, hesitates for a few samples, and then pushes on to its overall summit – roughly 2 units high – at index 37.  From that rounded peak it eases downward, losing about three-quarters of its height, levels off in a narrow, slightly noisy terrace, and then plunges decisively into its sharpest negative trough centred on index 74.  The curve rebounds, oscillates for many dozens of samples around small negative values and, after index 150, starts a fresh ascent.  That late-series swell broadens out and tops at about index 210–222, a little lower than the early maximum, before the waveform glides back down in gentle undulations to finish distinctly negative.

Best matching class: class_8


signal 2 – Description  
Beginning moderately negative, the curve dips a touch further to a mild bottom at index 7, reverses and rises steadily through the origin, touching an initial summit near index 30–32 and then continuing upward into a taller wave whose tip – and global peak, just over 2 units – occurs close to index 44.  It then drops abruptly, hitting a clear mid-run valley at index 48, wanders in low-amplitude ripples either side of the axis, and turns firmly negative around index 73–75 where it records a sharp trough.  After a spell spent in subdued oscillations it climbs again, producing one last but smaller crest centred near index 220–222, and finally drifts downward once more toward the close.

Best matching class: class_2


signal 3 – Description  
From an already negative starting level the signal dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, very smooth ascent that carries it through zero and onto a broad, gently rounded plateau peaking near index 28.  It relaxes slightly, gathers strength and swells into a second – and slightly higher – crest around index 59–61, which stands as the overall maximum.  A brisk slide follows, leading to the deepest negative excursion at about index 74.  Thereafter the waveform alternates smaller undulations, including a late, lower maximum around index 220, before edging back below the axis in the final samples.

Best matching class: class_3


signal 4 – Description  
The curve starts negative and sinks a little further until roughly index 7, then rises smoothly through zero, forming a rounded first high near index 26 before continuing to climb toward a taller twin-topped crest that reaches its overall maximum around index 38–44.  From there it falls off sharply into a distinct valley at index 47, meanders for a short while in low-amplitude ripples, and then plunges to its sharpest negative dip centred on index 74.  After hovering below zero it rallies, and ultimately builds a broad late-series rise whose peak at about index 216–221 is clearly lower than the early summit.  The trace then eases down again with small oscillations to finish in the negative.

Best matching class: class_8  (class 2 would be a respectable alternative)

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
The trace opens a little below zero and continues drifting down to a shallow minimum near index 5.  From there it begins an almost straight-line climb that crosses the axis at about index 15 and rolls upward into a broad high zone whose first crest appears at index 37.  A slight dip around index 41 is followed by a brief secondary bump at index 44, after which the record slips away, sliding past a series of small positive values and then dropping abruptly through the axis to hit its deepest negative excursion (≈ –1.2) close to index 74.  
A noisy, wavering recovery lifts the curve back toward the axis, but it sags again into a mid-series hollow centred near index 137.  From that point the signal embarks on a long, smooth late-run rise: it regains zero in the mid-140s, swells into an intermediate hump peaking about index 152 and then accelerates still further, reaching its overall maximum—just above twice its starting magnitude—near index 221.  Thereafter it glides downward in gentle undulations, crosses below zero once more and finishes in negative territory.  
Best match: class_5  

Signal 2  
Beginning moderately below the axis, the curve edges a little lower to a shallow bottom around index 7, then turns and climbs steadily through zero (≈ index 15).  It reaches an initial summit near index 26, but continues rising into a taller wave whose tip—and first major peak—occurs close to index 44.  From that height the trace drops sharply into a pronounced valley at index 47 and spends the next several dozen samples in small, slowly decaying ripples, finally slipping below zero in the third quarter (around index 73).  
After a spell of low-amplitude negativity it re-emerges, forming a second series of humps, and ultimately fashions a late, but smaller, crest around index 220.  A gentle decline then leads it back toward negative values in the closing samples.  
Best match: class_2  

Signal 3  
The waveform starts already negative, dips only slightly further during the first few samples and then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that crosses zero at about index 15.  It flattens into a broad shelf peaking near index 28, wavers gently downward, and swells again into a second—this time slightly higher—crest around index 59.  From there it slides quickly into its greatest negative trough at roughly index 74.  
The remainder of the record consists of smaller-scale undulations: low-amplitude positives alternate with negatives, producing a late but lower maximum a little past index 220 before the signal edges back below zero as it ends.  
Best match: class_3  

Signal 4  
The trace opens negative and continues falling until about index 7, where it turns and rises smoothly, crossing the axis near index 15.  It grows into a first prominent peak at index 37, dips briefly, then throws up a second, slightly lesser crest at index 44.  Immediately afterward the curve tumbles into its deepest negative excursion (≈ –1.2) at roughly index 78.  
A noisy shoulder follows, after which the signal climbs again, producing a mid-run bulge in the neighbourhood of index 95.  Eventually it gathers momentum for a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214.  From that summit it descends gradually, oscillating in ever-smaller ripples and ending a little below the axis.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

Signal 1  
After opening a little below the axis the trace slides marginally lower to a shallow minimum near index 5, then turns and climbs in a smooth, almost monotonic sweep that carries it through zero and up to its tallest crest—just past twice the starting magnitude—around index 40.  From that crown it slips away, oscillating downward into a broad mid-series hollow that bottoms near index 72, and thereafter spends a long spell meandering just under the axis in low-amplitude ripples.  Late in the run it gathers enough strength for one more but noticeably smaller swell that tops out around index 210, after which it drifts gently back into negative territory.  
Best-matching class: class_7  

Signal 2  
The curve begins moderately negative and dips a shade further to a shallow bottom close to index 7; it then reverses and rises steadily, crossing zero and touching an initial shoulder near index 25 before fanning out into a higher wave whose tip—and overall maximum—appears at roughly index 44.  Immediately afterwards the signal drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at about index 48, then wanders in subdued undulations, slipping below zero for much of the third quarter.  One last but clearly lower crest emerges near index 221, followed by a gentle descent toward the finish.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

Signal 3  
Starting from a negative level the waveform sags only briefly and then embarks on a long, smooth ascent, passing through the origin to form a broad, gently rounded plateau that peaks near index 28.  It eases downward, swells again into a second—but slightly higher—crest around index 60, and then slides into its deepest trough close to index 74.  The remainder of the record shows a series of progressively smaller undulations, including a late, lower maximum in the vicinity of index 220, before the trace finally drifts back below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_3  

Signal 4  
The signal opens negative and continues falling to its most negative point at about index 7.  A smooth up-slope then carries it through zero to a first prominent peak near index 38; after a short dip a brief secondary crest appears at roughly index 44.  The trace then tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, recovers through a noisy shoulder, and ultimately mounts a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214.  From that broad summit it descends gradually, with small ripples, to finish just below the axis.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
From a slightly negative opening the trace dips a little further to its first minimum (about –1.2) near index 5.  It then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing the axis around index 14.  After a modest shoulder near index 31 the curve pushes up to its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—at index 37.  A brief slide is followed by a small rebound that forms a secondary but lower bump at index 44, after which the waveform drops away into a mid-run hollow that bottoms out at its deepest negative excursion (≈–1.17) around index 74.  The series then wanders for a long spell just below zero, before lifting into a muted late-stage rise whose summit, a good deal lower than the first, lies close to index 210.  From there it drifts downward with mild oscillations, ending in the negative zone.  
Best-matching class: class_7  

signal 2  
The curve starts moderately below zero and slides a touch further to a shallow nadir at index 7.  It then rises steadily through the axis, reaching an initial summit near index 26.  After only a slight pause it continues upward, fanning out into a taller wave whose tip—and overall maximum—sits close to index 44.  A sharp descent follows, taking the trace through zero and on to a pronounced trough near index 74.  Through the middle section the signal meanders with low-amplitude ripples around the axis, but during the last quarter it swells again into a broad, though smaller, crest centred near index 210 before easing gradually downward toward the finish.  
Best-matching class: class_8  

signal 3  
Beginning in negative territory, the waveform dips only briefly to its early low (≈–1.15) at index 8, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that carries it through the origin and onto a broad, gently rounded plateau peaking near index 28.  A mild undulating decline follows, but the trace soon swells again into a second—and slightly higher—crest around index 59.  From there it slides into its deepest trough (about –1.29) near index 74.  The remainder of the record shows a sequence of smaller waves, including a late but lower peak around index 220, before the curve edges back below zero in the closing samples.  
Best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The series opens negative and continues falling until about index 7, where it reaches its first minimum near –1.18.  It then reverses, climbing smoothly across zero and forming a prominent peak near index 37.  After a short dip it produces a brief secondary crest at index 44.  A steep tumble takes the trace to its greatest negative excursion, again close to –1.18, around index 74.  Recovering through a noisy shoulder, it later gathers momentum into a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs roughly at index 214.  Finally, it descends gradually with small ripples to finish below the axis.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
It opens a touch below the axis, edges still lower to its shallowest start-of-run dip near index 5, then embarks on a smooth, uninterrupted climb that carries the trace through zero at about index 15 and up to a broad, rounded crest close to index 37; that early bulge – the overall high – tops the whole record.  A brief, ragged shoulder follows and the waveform tumbles almost vertically into a narrow mid-run hollow which bottoms just after index 47.  From there it drifts in small undulations, crosses into negative values during the third quarter and reaches its deepest trough (≈ index 74).  The curve later regains height, spending a long spell hovering around small values, then lifts into a final but noticeably lower crest centred a little past index 210 before sliding quietly back below zero by the end.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative it slips to a minimal low at index 7, turns and rises steadily through the origin, forming an initial summit near index 26.  The climb continues into a taller wave whose tip – and joint global maximum – stands at about index 44.  Immediately afterwards the record plunges into a marked hollow that bottoms at index 47, after which it wanders in subdued ripples, crosses the axis again and, during the third quarter, dives to its deepest negative dip around index 74.  A lengthy, low-energy plateau precedes a late-series revival: a broad but somewhat smaller crest appears near index 221, and the curve then fades downward, finishing in negative territory.  
Best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
From a negative level the curve dips only briefly in the opening handful of samples, then commences a long, even ascent that carries it through zero and onto a wide table whose first rounded top sits near index 28.  It eases slightly, undulates downward, then swells into a second – and marginally higher – crest around index 59.  A sharp slide leads into the deepest trough at roughly index 74.  Thereafter the trace alternates smaller waves, including a late, lower maximum a little beyond index 220, before drifting back below the axis in the closing samples.  
Best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The trace starts negative and keeps falling to its most pronounced early dip at about index 7.  It then climbs smoothly, crossing zero near index 16 and rolling into a prominent peak at roughly index 37; after a shallow notch a brief secondary crest rises at index 44.  A steep descent follows, carrying the signal to its strongest negative excursion close to index 74.  Recovering through a noisy shoulder, the waveform later mounts a sustained, late-run surge whose highest point occurs around index 214.  From that summit it tails off gradually, peppered with small ripples, and ends modestly below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_4

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace opens a little below zero and slides to a shallow earliest trough about index 5.  From there it rises smoothly, crosses the axis near index 15 and forms a modest shoulder around index 31 before driving on to its highest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—at index 37-38.  It then slips off that peak and undulates downward, reaching a broad mid-series sag whose centre lies close to index 72-75 (the most negative point of the run).  During the third quarter it hovers close to the axis with low-amplitude ripples, and toward index 210 it lifts again into a secondary, noticeably lower summit at about index 210-215.  After that late bump the curve declines with gentle oscillations and finishes in negative territory.  
Best-matching class: class_7  

signal 2  
Beginning slightly below the axis it edges down a few samples further to a shallow minimum near index 7, then embarks on a long, steady climb that carries it through zero and into a rounded first crest around index 37-38.  After a brief shoulder the ascent resumes, pushing on to an even taller wave whose tip—and overall maximum—sits near index 44.  The waveform then drops sharply, settling into a subdued, rippling stretch that meanders about small positive values before plunging to its deepest negative dip at roughly index 74.  A noisy, shallow hollow occupies the middle of the record (centred near index 135).  In the last quarter the signal accelerates once more, sweeping upward in its broadest late-series rise and reaching a new, still higher peak near index 220-222, before gliding back down and closing on a negative note.  
Best-matching class: class_1  

signal 3  
From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly (minimum near index 8), then begins a smooth, extended ascent that crosses zero and settles onto a wide, gently rounded plateau peaking near index 28-30.  A mild undulation downward follows, but the trace swells again into a second—and slightly higher—crest centred close to index 58-61.  Thereafter it slides into its deepest trough at about index 74, recovers and alternates a series of progressively smaller waves.  One of these late ripples produces a modest secondary maximum near index 218-222, after which the signal eases downward once more and ends a little below zero.  
Best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The waveform starts negative and continues falling to its lowest early point around index 7.  It then climbs smoothly, crossing the axis and producing a first prominent peak near index 37-38.  A shallow dip is followed immediately by a brief secondary crest at about index 43-45.  Next comes a precipitous drop to the global negative extremum at roughly index 74.  The curve rebounds through a noisy shoulder and eventually gathers momentum into a broad, late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214-223.  Finally it descends gradually, sprinkled with small ripples, and settles back into the negative region by the end of the record.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace begins a little below zero and slides to its shallowest opening dip near index 5.  From there it embarks on a steady, smooth climb that carries it through the axis about index 15 and on to its tallest crest – the global maximum – at roughly index 37.  After a brief, uneven shoulder it drops away, first to moderate positive levels and then into a wandering, low-amplitude stretch.  The record finally sinks through zero and reaches its deepest negative valley close to index 74.  A noisy mid-section follows, centred in the 130s, after which the curve mounts one last but noticeably smaller rise whose top appears near index 221.  Gentle undulations then lead it back downward so that it finishes below the axis.

Matched class: class_2


signal 2  
Starting moderately negative, the signal slips a little farther to a shallow minimum at index 7, reverses and crosses zero about index 15.  It rises to an initial shoulder around index 30 before continuing into a higher wave whose tip—and overall peak—sits near index 44.  The trace then plunges sharply, touching a low positive hollow at index 47 and turning fully negative in the mid-70s where its deepest dip occurs.  Through the third quarter it ripples with small amplitude, and near index 221 it lifts into a final but lower crest.  Thereafter it eases down again, ending in the negative zone.

Matched class: class_2


signal 3  
From an already negative starting level the curve only briefly dips lower, then begins a long, smooth ascent that carries it through zero and onto a broad plateau peaking about index 28.  It drifts gently downward, swells again into a second – and slightly higher – crest centred near index 61, and then slides into its deepest trough at roughly index 74.  Thereafter it alternates smaller waves, with a late, lower maximum around index 220, before edging back below zero in the closing samples.

Matched class: class_3


signal 4  
The record opens negative and declines to a floor near index 7, then turns sharply upward, crossing zero and forming a prominent first peak around index 37.  After a modest dip it produces a brief secondary crest at about index 44, then tumbles to its deepest negative excursion close to index 74.  Rising again through a noisy shoulder, it eventually launches a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs near index 223.  Finally it descends gradually, rippling back into negative territory toward the end.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace starts a little below the axis and glides down to its shallowest opening dip (about –1.2) at index 5.  From there it sets off on a long, steady climb that crosses zero near index 15 and crests for the first time at index 37, where it tops two units.  A brief shoulder follows: the curve slips to the high-1’s around index 40, rebounds into a low secondary bump near index 44, then eases into a noisy, low-amplitude plateau that hovers a few tenths above zero from roughly index 48 to the low 70’s.  An abrupt plunge delivers the deepest negative excursion (≈ –1.17) at index 74.  After a jagged mid-run hollow centred in the 130’s the waveform gathers pace once more, sweeping upward in its broadest, smoothest rise to the overall maximum (≈ 2.0) at index 221.  From that late summit it glides back down through gentle undulations, recrosses the axis, and closes in the negative.  
best-matching class: class_5  

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative, the curve dips a touch further to a mild bottom at index 7, then reverses and rises steadily through zero (≈ index 15).  It forms a first summit near index 30, keeps climbing and rolls into a taller wave whose tip—and global peak—sits close to index 44 (≈ 2.14).  An abrupt drop lands it in a mid-run valley around index 47, after which it meanders in low, mainly positive ripples before sliding below zero in the third quarter (around index 72).  Late in the record it manages one last, but smaller, crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the finish.  
best-matching class: class_2  

signal 3  
From an already negative level the curve nudges fractionally lower to its early minimum at index 8, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that crosses the axis near index 15 and settles onto a broad, gently rounded plateau peaking about index 28.  It drifts down only slightly, swells into a second—and slightly higher—crest around index 61, and then slides into its deepest trough (≈ –1.29) at index 74.  Thereafter the waveform alternates smaller waves, raising a late, lower maximum near index 220, before edging back below zero in the closing samples.  
best-matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
The record opens negative and continues falling to its early minimum (≈ –1.18) at index 7.  It then turns upward, crossing zero near index 15 and forming a first prominent peak around index 37.  A shallow dip is followed by a brief secondary crest at index 44, after which the curve tumbles to its greatest negative excursion (≈ –1.18) at index 74.  Rising once more through a noisy shoulder, it mounts a sustained late-series surge that reaches its highest point close to index 223.  Finally it descends gradually, peppered with small ripples, and finishes a little below the axis.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
The final line of the response string should be just the names of the predicted classes (comma separated) - exactly in the above notation.

signal 1  
The trace opens just below zero, sinks a little further to its first—and early—minimum around index 5, then swings upward, crosses the axis and climbs to a broad, rounded crest close to index 37. It eases off briefly, rebounds into a shorter secondary bump near index 45, and then plunges to its deepest negative dip at about index 75. After a noisy, low-level middle stretch it gathers pace again, rising in a long, smooth surge whose overall maximum arrives near index 222. From that late summit it glides downward in mild ripples, ending once more on the negative side.  
Matched class: class_4  

signal 2  
Beginning moderately negative it slips a touch lower to a shallow bottom at about index 7, reverses and rises through zero to a first, modest crest just past index 25–30. Without pausing it continues climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and global peak—sits near index 44. The curve then falls abruptly into a valley centred on index 47, spends the middle portion wavering with small-amplitude ripples and turns negative for much of the third quarter. It finally musters one last but smaller high around index 220 before tapering away downward toward the finish.  
Matched class: class_2  (class 8 is a distant alternative, but the earlier small crest at ~27 and sharp drop at 47 follow class 2 more closely)

signal 3  
From a still-negative start the series dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that carries it through zero onto a wide plateau peaking near index 28. It drifts gently downward, swells again into a second—and slightly higher—crest at about index 61, and thereafter slides into its deepest trough around index 74. The remainder of the record alternates smaller waves, including a late but lower maximum near index 221, before edging back below zero in the closing samples.  
Matched class: class_3  

signal 4  
The curve starts negative and continues falling until roughly index 7, then turns upward, crossing the axis and forming a prominent peak close to index 37. After a short dip it produces a brief secondary crest at about index 44, followed by a tumble to its greatest negative excursion near index 74. A noisy shoulder precedes a sustained late-series rise whose highest point occurs around index 223; thereafter the signal descends gradually with gentle oscillations and finishes below zero.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
From a mildly negative opening the trace edges down a little further to its first shallow minimum near index 5, then swings into a long, even ascent that carries it through the axis and up to a broad, rounded crest—the overall high—about index 37.  A brief, irregular shoulder follows and the curve slips back, hovering in small positive ripples before plunging to its deepest negative dip at roughly index 74.  It recovers, undulates around small values and builds a second, lower wave that tops near index 153; after another lull it drifts upward once more into a late-series dome peaking close to index 202, is punctuated by a smaller spike near index 221, and finally glides gradually downward with gentle oscillations to finish below zero.  
best matching class: class_8  

signal 2  
The series begins a little below the axis, sinks a shade lower to a local floor around index 7, then embarks on a smooth, steady rise that crosses zero and produces a first rounded summit near index 24.  Without breaking stride it continues climbing, fanning out into a taller wave whose tip—and first major maximum—occurs close to index 44.  The line then falls abruptly into a hollow centred about index 74, ripples weakly for a while, spends much of the third quarter in negative territory, and finally accelerates into its broadest surge: a late, global peak around index 220.  From there it eases back through small undulations to end negative.  
best matching class: class_1  

signal 3  
After starting distinctly negative the curve dips only slightly deeper to a brief low at about index 8, then begins a long, smooth climb that takes it through the origin and onto a wide plateau whose first crest sits near index 28.  It sags gently, then swells again into a second—and slightly higher—peak around index 59, before sliding swiftly down to its most negative trough close to index 74.  Thereafter the waveform alternates smaller positive and negative undulations, raising a late but lower summit near index 220, and finally edges back below zero in the closing samples.  
best matching class: class_3  

signal 4  
Opening on the negative side, the signal continues downward to its initial minimum near index 7, turns and climbs smoothly through zero and up to a prominent first peak about index 37.  A minor dip and brief secondary crest follow at roughly index 44, after which the trace plunges to its deepest negative excursion near index 74.  It then rises through a noisy mid-series shoulder and, late in the record, launches a long, sustained surge whose highest point lies close to index 214.  The curve then descends gradually, ornamented by small ripples, and finishes back in negative territory.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
From a slightly negative outset the trace slides a little lower, touching its first and only true minimum around index 5.  It then embarks on a smooth, sustained climb that crosses zero near index 15, rolls across a modest shoulder about index 26 and presses on to its absolute summit at roughly index 37.  After that rounded crest it backs off, meanders through a ragged positive shelf and then plunges smartly into a sharp, deepest-negative dip centred on index 74.  The middle of the record is spent oscillating close to the axis until, late in the run, the curve accelerates again into a broad swell whose high point (lower than the early maximum) sits near index 222.  Finally it glides down in gentle undulations to finish below zero.  
→ best fits class_8  

signal 2  
Beginning moderately below the axis, the waveform sinks a fraction further to a shallow nadir at index 7, then turns upward and crosses zero, topping an initial rise near index 26.  Without pausing it keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—occurs close to index 44.  It drops abruptly into a brief valley about index 47, thereafter drifting in small-amplitude ripples that become negative through the third quarter.  In the closing section it gathers for one last, clearly smaller crest around index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.  
→ best fits class_2  

signal 3  
From an already negative level the signal scarcely dips before launching a long, smooth ascent through the origin to a broad, near-flat plateau that tops out around index 28.  A gentle sag follows, then the trace swells into a second—slightly higher—crest near index 59, after which it slides into its deepest trough at roughly index 74.  The remainder alternates smaller waves, including a late, lower maximum just past index 220, before the curve drifts back beneath zero in the final samples.  
→ best fits class_3  

signal 4  
The curve opens negative and continues falling until about index 7, then reverses and climbs steadily, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 38.  A short dip precedes a brief secondary crest at about index 44, after which the waveform tumbles to its greatest negative excursion near index 74.  Recovering through a noisy shoulder it mounts a sustained late-series surge whose high point—comparable to the earlier peak—lies close to index 214.  It then descends gradually with small ripples, ending once more in negative territory.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.

signal 1  
The trace starts a little below zero and slides a touch lower to a first shallow minimum near index 5.  From there it sets off on a long, smooth climb that crosses the axis and rolls into a broad first hill whose top—and overall summit—appears close to index 37.  It then slips rapidly, forming a brief shoulder that bottoms near index 48, wanders in low-amplitude ripples and, after crossing zero again, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74.  Through the mid-series it undulates around small values, raises a modest hump near index 105 and another at about 153, stays negative for much of the third quarter, and finally accelerates into a late-series rise whose crest, lower than the early giant but still pronounced, sits around index 221.  Gentle oscillations carry it downward once more so that the record closes on the negative side.  
best matching class: class_2  (possible but weaker alternative: class_7)

signal 2  
Beginning moderately below the axis, the curve dips a fraction further to a shallow bottom around index 7, then turns and climbs steadily through zero to an initial summit at roughly index 26.  The ascent continues into a taller wave whose tip—and global maximum—lies near index 44.  An abrupt drop follows, reaching a mid-run valley at about index 48; thereafter the signal drifts in small ripples, sinks below zero through the third quarter, and mounts one last but noticeably smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the finish.  
best matching class: class_2

signal 3  
From an already negative level the waveform dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, even ascent that crosses the axis and levels into a wide plateau peaking near index 28.  It undulates gently downward, swells into a second and slightly higher crest—the overall peak—around index 59 – 61, and then slides into its deepest trough close to index 74.  Beyond that point it alternates smaller waves, producing a late but lower high near index 220, and finally fades back below zero in the closing samples.  
best matching class: class_3

signal 4  
Opening on the negative side, the signal keeps falling until about index 7, then reverses into a smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first prominent peak near index 37.  After a short dip it throws up a brief secondary crest at roughly index 44 before tumbling to its greatest negative excursion around index 74.  Recovering through a noisy shoulder, it later generates a sustained surge whose highest point—and global maximum—occurs close to index 223, after which it descends gradually with gentle ripples to end below the axis once more.

prompt..
 There is a number of symbolic descriptions of signals:

class_1: It begins slightly below the axis, slips a few samples lower, then swings upward in a long, smooth climb that crosses zero and reaches a first rounded crest near index 37; after a short, uneven shoulder it sags and meanders around small values, dives to its deepest negative dip at about index 74, recovers through a noisy mid-series hollow centred near index 137 and finally accelerates into its broadest rise, topping out at the global maximum around index 210, before gliding back down with gentle oscillations to finish negative.
class_2: Starting moderately negative it falls a touch further to a shallow bottom around index 7, reverses and rises steadily through zero to an initial summit near index 26, then keeps climbing into a taller wave whose tip—and overall peak—appears close to index 44; the trace then drops abruptly into a mid-run valley at index 47, drifts in low-amplitude ripples, turns negative during the third quarter, and mounts one last but smaller crest near index 221 before easing downward again toward the end.
class_3: From an already negative level the curve dips only briefly, then embarks on a long, smooth ascent that takes it through the origin and onto a broad plateau peaking near index 28; it undulates gently downward, swells into a second but slightly higher crest around index 59, slides into its deepest trough near index 74, and thereafter alternates smaller waves—with a late, lower maximum around index 220—before edging back below zero in the closing samples.
class_4: The trace opens negative and keeps falling until about index 7, then turns and climbs smoothly, crossing zero and forming a first prominent peak near index 37; after a minor dip and a brief secondary crest at index 44 it tumbles to its greatest negative excursion around index 74, rises again through a noisy shoulder, and eventually produces a sustained late-series surge whose highest point occurs close to index 214, after which it descends gradually with small ripples into the negative zone once more.
class_5: An initial, gentle slide to a minimum at index 6 is followed by a steady, almost linear rise that crosses the axis and crests for the first time near index 36; a noisy plateau gives way to an abrupt plunge to the main negative trough at about index 74, the waveform then recovers, oscillates around small values, and builds a long, smooth climb that peaks globally near index 210 before slipping back down below zero toward the finish.
class_6: Beginning slightly negative it drifts lower to a shallow bottom at index 7, then embarks on an extended climb, crossing zero and fanning out into a broad high zone whose top (and overall maximum) sits near index 61; from there it steps down through a series of ripples, plummets to its deepest dip around index 74, rebounds in a modest mid-range hump, and ends with a gentle rise that stalls near index 210 before tapering away with small undulations.
class_7: The curve starts negative, sinks a little further until about index 5, then rises steadily through zero, developing an initial bump around index 31 and reaching its tallest crest—just over twice the starting magnitude—near index 40; it then slips off that peak, oscillates downward into a shallow mid-series hollow centred roughly at index 72, spends a long spell hovering just below zero, and finally lifts into a subdued late peak around index 217 before sliding back into negative territory at the close.
class_8: After a brief dip the signal mounts a gentle, sustained ascent that crosses zero and tops out in a first rounded high near index 38; it relaxes slightly, then pushes on to its global maximum around index 44, descends quickly into a sharp trough at about index 74, spends the middle section wavering close to the axis, and eventually rises again into a broad late crest peaking close to index 210, from which it glides downward in small undulations to end below zero.

In the following separated lists of values, describe each list, i.e., signal, in a similar fashion to the above symbolic descriptions.

Describe them at the same granularity as the examples above. Only then match each description to the best fitting class. Sometimes several might match in a way, it is important then to select the one that matches more precisely. If there ever is a case that really does match several classes VERY WELL, mention your best guess and then mention the alternative in brackets as well. Important: only match things that actually reasonably match; it is crucial to also identify signals that don't match any class. There also might be duplicates, i.e., more than one signal matching the same class. Important: Not every detail must match, it is important that it matches the broad scheme best, not every detail. Focus on the broad shape, not minor details, but mention the index of relevant peaks. However, avoid using absolute values in the descriptions (except indices). When it comes to the matching, it is important that the indices of peaks must allow some tolerance for deviations, they should only roughly match.
